[{"knowledge": "Foreword Scaling sustainability impact In a tumultuous year of record-shattering heatwaves, wild- fires and floods, and despite rising energy prices, inflation,  supply chain challenges, labor shortages, plus the impact of  growing geopolitical tensions, we remain optimistic about  technology as the answer to some of the world\u2019s biggest  challenges. Our technology empowers our customers and  partners to scale their sustainability impact faster across the  backbone of our economies. As we approach a critical tipping  point for our planet, the demand to accelerate the digital  and sustainability transformations has never been greater. As a leading technology company, Siemens supports cus- tomers all over the world to become more competitive,  resilient, and, above all, more sustainable. Our portfolio  enables a positive impact on our planet and society at scale.  Today, it is about more than just managing negative foot- prints; it is about a company\u2019s handprint and increasingly  expanding businesses\u2019 net-positive impact on the world.  That is why Siemens has integrated its sustainability strategy  in our business activities, technology roadmap, investment  decisions, own operations, and governance. We empower  our customers to accelerate their sustainability goals along  three impact areas: decarbonization & energy efficiency,  resource efficiency & circularity, people centricity & societal  impact. Our purpose \u2013 which has guided us for 176 years \u2013 is to  create technology to transform the everyday, for everyone.  This technology with purpose touches the lives of customers,  partners, and consumers everywhere \u2013 improving the quality  of life for billions of people worldwide. Technology with  purpose is about leveraging digitalization for optimized  resource usage and circularity readiness and accelerating the  energy transition through renewable integration, energy  efficiency, and electrification. It is about societal impact  by designing and operating the most efficient train and  e-mobility solutions within sustainable communities, built  upon decarbonized building technologies. And it is about  pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare to improve the lives  of patients and their families. Combining the real and digital worlds Our strategy is to combine the real and digital worlds \u2013   harnessing the power of hardware and software, or OT and  IT. More than 90% of Siemens AG\u2019s business enables positive  sustainability outcomes for our customers. Worth highlight- ing is that our products sold to customers in fiscal 2023 will,  over the course of their lifetime, avoid around 190 million  metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions \u2013 a significant  increase in avoided emissions over the prior year. This   represents more than the equivalent emissions of the   Netherlands. In contrast, our own operations and supply  chain accounted for around 12 million tons of greenhouse  gas emissions. Foreword"}, {"knowledge": "To help our customers and partners accelerate their transfor- mation, we recently introduced Siemens Xcelerator, an open  digital business platform that makes digital transformation  easier, faster, and more scalable for companies of all sizes. A  key element of this platform is a growing ecosystem of  partners. The sustainability impact we create is more powerful  when all partners pool their strengths and work together  toward a common goal. We are able to empower our customers to scale sustainability  impact because we address challenges across the entire  value chain \u2013 with deep domain know-how across many  industries and across ecosystems of suppliers, partners, and  customers. An excellent example of the power of ecosystems is how  software can track and manage carbon footprints throughout  lifecycles and along supply chains. SiGREEN, an emissions-  tracking tool on our Siemens Xcelerator platform, enables  companies to connect to all their suppliers, enabling data- driven decisions to reduce product carbon footprints and  decarbonize at scale. Our DEGREE sustainability framework And we do not stop at the sustainability impact of our port- folio. We define our environmental, social, and governance  (ESG) ambitions within our DEGREE sustainability framework \u2013  a 360-degree approach reflecting our core sustainability  values. We look at sustainability from every angle with clear  ambitions in six fields of action \u2013 Decarbonization, Ethics,  Governance, Resource efficiency, Equity, and Employability. We have a clear position on responsible business conduct.  And our DEGREE commitments are based on that. Ethical  behavior, integrity and compliance are nonnegotiable. They  go beyond strict adherence to rules by firmly placing respon- sible action sustainably at the core of our culture and busi- ness conduct. We are also focused on our own environmental footprint: In  2015, as one of the first global companies to do so, we  committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Today, we  are on track, and we have already accelerated. We are proud  to have reduced our CO2 footprint from our operations by  50% (without offsetting) since 2019 and are targeting 90%  in 2030. We reduced our energy consumption by 9% since  fiscal 2021, meanwhile 96% of our locations have imple- mented a water strategy. Applying our own technologies in our own operations is key  to achieving these ambitions. In Nanjing, China, for example,  we consolidated three production sites into one lean and  green digital native factory, which was first built as a digital  twin. This led to annual savings of 5,000,000 kWh of energy,  3,300 metric tons of CO2, and 6,000 m3 of water. At the  same time, productivity went up by 20%. For Siemens,  rethinking scalable products and services for a sustainable  world should go hand in hand with savings, efficiency gains,  and customer value. Foreword"}, {"knowledge": "Our sustainability ambitions are supported by 320,000   colleagues who bring our purpose to life every day \u2013 in an  increasingly inclusive environment in 190 countries around  the world. Within Siemens AG, women now hold 31% of top  management roles, having achieved our 2025 ambition for  30% two years ahead of time. Our people are at the heart of  this company. In fiscal 2023 we invested \u20ac416 million in our  active learning culture, ensuring sustainable employability in  rapidly changing markets. We have also made progress in the  number of hours our people spent learning across the three  strategic focus areas of digitalization, sustainability, and  leadership: On average, our people have accrued 23 digital  learning hours per person per year. And they are on track to  increase that to our ambition of 25 digital learning hours by  2025. Easier, faster, and at scale We create technology to transform the everyday, for everyone.  By combining the real and digital worlds we can accelerate  digital and sustainability transformations easier, faster, and  at scale. Together, by scaling across ecosystems, we will  continue to leverage the power of the digital world to have  a positive sustainability impact in our precious real world.

To meet our customers\u2019 needs and the constantly changing  demands of the markets, Siemens draws on a global sales  force that takes its guidance from our regional companies.  Key success factors include a strong customer focus, digital  transformation, efficient processes, and collaboration with  external partners. 1 We call any current or potential purchaser of Siemens products or services, no matter what the sales channel, a \u201ccustomer.\u201d Some customers who are especially significant for Siemens are called \u201cKey Customers\u201d. 1.2 Company profile"}, {"knowledge": "Sustainable growth through digital transformation  The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated digitalization.  New business models are emerging, and the importance of  collaborative partnerships within ecosystems is increasing,  especially in the context of sustainability challenges that  cannot be solved unilaterally. We need to achieve more, and  we need to do it sustainably while consuming fewer  resources. We can do this by increasing our efficiency with  the help of new technologies and by working in ecosystems  with new business models to keep resources in circulation. Combining the real and digital worlds represents a major  leap forward for Siemens and our customers as well as for  industries, planet, and society. This will help shape a world  where intelligent manufacturing, smart energy systems,  smart buildings, and connected mobility can make our infra- structure more sustainable and our lives easier. Technology is driving sustainability, and the digital transfor- mation is also essential to accelerating sustainability. To  speed up our customers\u2019 digital transformation and increase  their value added, we have created Siemens Xcelerator, an  open digital business platform. It is intended to accelerate  digital transformation (easier, faster, and at scale). It com- prises three fundamental elements: 1. A curated modular portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware,  software, and digital services from Siemens and certified  partners based on standard application programming  interfaces (APIs) 2. An ever-growing open ecosystem of partners 3. An evolving marketplace that enables customers, partners,  and developers to explore, teach, and exchange digital  solutions. The platform is constantly growing and provides many market-  tested solutions that enable customers to easily begin their  sustainability projects. These projects can include managing  energy efficiency, integrating renewable energies, and saving  resources. Siemens Xcelerator provides cybersecurity   standards at every level to reduce risks for customers. Customer Impact At Siemens we rely on a mature Key Account Management  approach to systematically structure and drive our Key Cus- tomer relationships company-wide. While all our customers  are served by the general Sales organization, Key Customers  are also managed through our Key Account Management  approach. Over and above our basic sales approach, Siemens\u2019 primary  principles for successful Key Account Management are a  special understanding of our customers\u2019 technology and  vertical markets along with the collaboration among all  customer-facing parties \u2013 across functional, organizational,  and regional boundaries (\u201cgo-to-market\u201d approach). Our harmonized Key Account Management process enables  us to act as one company and serve our customers in a  global, sustainably coordinated approach. Key Account Management \u2013 A holistic   approach to meeting customer needs Systematically measuring and improving customer satisfaction We use the Net Promoter Score (NPS) every year to measure  customer satisfaction, and by extension, the quality of our  partnerships. Management compensation at Siemens also  includes a component that is based on customer satisfaction.  This component incorporates long-term performance incen- tives using ESG criteria and is defined under Governance in  our DEGREE sustainability framework. The assessment is  based on the internal ESG/Sustainability index, which  includes the Net Promoter Score2, among others.3  2 Assessment based on the Siemens internal ESG/sustainability index, which is based on customer satisfaction (Net Promoter Score), CO2 reduction, and digital learning hours.3 Siemens without SHS. 1.2 Company profile"}, {"knowledge": "Our customers\u2019 satisfaction   is our top priority Siemens\u2019 systematic evaluation draws from customer satisfac- tion surveys conducted annually worldwide. The score itself   is based on a single question: \u201cHow likely is it that you would  recommend Siemens to a colleague or business partner?\u201d The survey pursues a holistic approach to customer relations  because it follows up by implementing processes and systems  designed to help foster long-term customer loyalty.4  Regardless of the score, we initiate a follow-up process after  the survey, both internally and externally. When a score is  low and considered critical, we take immediate action to  identify key issues and determine what measures are needed  to improve the relationship. Despite the tense global situation (for example, with supply  bottlenecks for materials and goods), our customers have  recognized us for our customer support, reliable products,  and a wide range of offerings. By consistently addressing  their concerns, we have achieved a higher Net Promoter  Score than the previous year. We are focusing on areas where we can make a difference.  This means creating sustainable, long-term value for our  customers, for the environment, for society, and for the  people who work for Siemens. Research and Development At Siemens our purpose is to provide innovations that  improve the quality of life and create added value for people  all over the world. Innovation strengthens Siemens and its customers  Our Research and Development (R&D) activities are geared  towards developing innovative and sustainable solutions for  Siemens\u2019 customers and businesses, while simultaneously  strengthening our competitive positioning.

We are also facing challenges  related to resource efficiency and material extraction,  water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. \u2192 In times of crisis, glocalization can create a greater balance  between the global and the local in our economy. For  instance, by ensuring production of our products and  solutions near our customers, we can strengthen our  resilience to shocks while also reducing the environmental  impact of our products.  \u2192 Increasing urbanization, especially in less-developed  regions, is a significant megatrend. In this context, the  demand for more sustainable and efficient products,  technologies, and solutions \u2013 including passenger trans- portation and access to renewable energy \u2013 continues to  grow as more and more people move to cities. \u2192 As global population growth progresses at a slower pace,  our societies are aging, and an increasing number of  people need medical care. This demographic change is  also contributing to a shortage of workers across industries. \u2192 Lastly, digitalization continues to accelerate advancements  in connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT), automation,  and AI technologies. Digitalization is being rapidly  adopted by multiple industries in the public and private  sectors. By optimizing processes, it can play a decisive role  in reducing environmental impacts. 1.3 Strategy"}, {"knowledge": "Scaling sustainability impact These megatrends and their impacts are reshaping the needs  of our customers and markets. To create a holistic picture of  potential futures, we execute sustainability scenario analyses  that enable us to map impacts and risks, identify opportunities,  and find new ways to create value through pathways by  2030 and 2040. Strategic insights are derived from scientific  frameworks like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change\u2019s (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways  (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) as well as  market trends and expert knowledge. The sustainability  scenarios illustrate different possible development pathways  for the global economy and Siemens\u2019 operating environment  across the focus topics climate, circularity, biodiversity, and  society that take into account both an organized 1.5\u00b0C and a  disorganized 3\u00b0C pathway. These scenarios guide the devel- opment of our sustainability strategy. To further increase our positive impact, we believe that  working in ecosystems is the best way to jointly create seam- less solutions for our customers and their specific challenges.  This approach increases our own sustainable offerings and  solutions and facilitates our customers\u2019 sustainability trans- formation. Our commitment to sustainability covers the  entire value chain. Based on our strategic priority to produce  purpose-driven technology, we strive to create a positive  long-term impact for our customers with our products across  our operations and through connected ecosystems.  Supporting our customers in their sustainability transformation Siemens\u2019 business is focused on enabling customers to  achieve a positive sustainability impact along the following  value propositions: Decarbonization & energy efficiency We support our customers with their efforts to decarbonize  their infrastructure and operations, drive energy-efficiency,  and future-proof entire industries. We do this by offering  products, systems, solutions, and services that are based on  our strategic focus on digitalization, electrification, and  automation. For example, our energy-efficient products and  solutions support the transition from fossil fuels to renew- able energy sources, and our electrification solutions enable  renewable grid integration and the electrification of heat  and hydrogen. Across industries, we offer energy optimiza- tion and carbon footprint management throughout our  products\u2019 lifecycles and supply chains. In buildings, we offer  energy efficiency and decarbonization solutions, such as  smart buildings and smart energy management for a reduced  carbon footprint. Our rail systems offer low-carbon mobility  and increased energy efficiency. Resource efficiency & circularity Through their use of our digital technology, our customers  can achieve resource efficiency and profitability. For  instance, we harness digitalization to reduce the require- ments of physical assets and resources. We combine the real  and the digital worlds with our digital twin technology, a  virtual representation of a physical product or process that is  used to simulate, predict, and optimize its physical counter- part. Digital twins enable users to do more with fewer  resources and make current and future environmental foot- prints transparent. Our building solutions also contribute to  optimized space utilization and ultimately increase resource  efficiency. Our mobility solutions focus on enhanced network  capacity and extended lifecycles.  1.3 Strategy"}, {"knowledge": "People centricity & societal impact We enable our partners and customers to improve people\u2019s  lives today and transform the backbone of societies for a  better tomorrow. For instance, our technologies support the  well-being, productivity, safety, and security of building  tenants and operators. Similarly, in the field of mobility,  passengers and operators benefit from greater safety and  convenience thanks to our technologies. They also promote  the socioeconomic development of communities by enabling  access to basic goods, resilient electric power, affordable real  estate, food and water, healthcare, education, and public  transportation. DEGREE: High ambitions for sustainability Sustainability is integral to our business and influences  everything we do. The DEGREE sustainability framework  defines our comprehensive approach to sustainability. Across  six fields of action, the framework defines clear priorities for  us in key sustainability areas that we drive in our own oper- ations and in collaboration with our partners, suppliers, and  customers. We continuously develop these priorities and  ambitions while fully integrating the expectations of all our  stakeholders. The fields of action are defined along the  dimensions of Environment, Social, and Governance: Environment: Decarbonization, Resource efficiency As part of DEGREE, we have set high ambitions to signifi- cantly reduce CO2e emissions in Siemens\u2019 operations and  upstream supply chain. Our approach to resource efficiency  accelerates recycling and promotes a more circular business.  Our software and simulations reduce the use of substances  of concern and other resource usage and introduce recycled  materials as early as the design and simulation phases of our  products, factories, and solutions. In addition, we promote  the decoupling of natural resource consumption from eco- nomic growth by increasing the amount of secondary  materials that we purchase. Social: Equity, Employability Equal treatment and respect are the core of our corporate  values. Our goal is to position Siemens as the inclusive  employer of choice in all our relevant talent markets. We  foster diversity, equity, inclusion, and community develop- ment in order to create a sense of belonging and a healthy  and safe environment where all our people can give their  best. At Siemens, we invest in the education, development,  and individual growth of our people. We maintain a strong  focus on digital learning, employee assistance programs,  and occupational health and safety. Governance: Ethics, Governance At Siemens, we believe that the way we do business is as  important as our business success. Our values and ethical  principles are embedded in our Business Conduct Guidelines,  which are mandatory throughout the company. In addition  to embedding these principles in our own management  systems, we extend them to our suppliers who are required  to follow a comprehensive Code of Conduct. Beyond that,  we have made sustainability criteria an integral part of our  long-term variable compensation programs1 for both the  Managing Board and our senior management.2 The DEGREE sustainability framework applies to Siemens AG  apart from Siemens Healthineers (SHS), which is an indepen- dent stock-listed company. In its sustainability concept, SHS  pursues the same values as Siemens AG, because they repre- sent our expectations as the majority shareholder. SHS\u2019s own  sustainability approach is described in a dedicated report. 1 Assessment based on the Siemens internal ESG/sustainability index, which is based on customer satisfaction (Net Promoter Score), CO2 reduction, and digital learning hours.2 Siemens without SHS. 1.3 Strategy"}, {"knowledge": "Pages 20 \u2013 30  Our sustainability  management"}, {"knowledge": "\u2013 Materiality assessment based on GRI 2021\u2013 15 material sustainability topics of the greatest   relevance to Siemens  \u2013 Material impacts, risks, and opportunities as part  of our strategic considerations Key topics as guiding principles Our materiality assessment is based on external frameworks  like the UN Global Compact and the Standards of the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI 2021), which are the foundation for  our reporting. The key topics covered in this report are struc- tured based on ESG. Materiality assessment We updated our materiality assessment with an emphasis  on our industrial businesses Digital Industries, Smart Infra- structure, and Mobility in fiscal 2023 based on the GRI 2021  standards. Our aim was to identify our company\u2019s key eco- nomic, ecological, and social impacts on the environment  and society in accordance with the updated GRI Standards.  The resulting topics also align with Siemens Healthineers\u2019  (SHS) material topics, which were determined in an indepen- dent materiality assessment. The material topics form the framework for implementing  sustainability in the company \u2013 at the central corporate  level, in our business units, and in the countries. Siemens  strives to continuously improve sustainability management  and understands the materiality assessment to be a prereq- uisite for identifying and managing potential opportunities  and risks. The Siemens business units derive their key action  areas from the requirements and basic conditions of their  local markets. 2.1Materiality assessment Identifying and prioritizing the topics  In 2023, Siemens conducted internal workshops to help  identify our material topics by assessing their impacts, risks,  and opportunities from two different perspectives:  \u2192 Inside\u00adout perspective: Siemens took a closer look at its positive and negative  impacts on the environment and society (inside-out) caused  by the company\u2019s business activities.  During the inside-out assessment, we identified actual and  potential positive and negative impacts for 17 sustainability  topics and evaluated them according to their likelihood and  their severity. Based on evaluations of the individual impacts,  our material topics were derived. These topics are the foun- dation for determining the content of the GRI report. Including  the outside-in perspective (see below) does not alter the  results. The material topics where Siemens can exert the greatest  influence on society and the environment are climate action,  social and ecological standards in the supply chain, and   sustainable product design and lifecycle management. These  topics received the highest scores in this year\u2019s analysis.  \u2192 Outside\u00adin perspective: The outside-in perspective refers to sustainability topics that  can be associated with opportunities and risks for the   company\u2019s business activities or financial situation. This  perspective was taken into account in the inside-out per- spective in order to introduce the double materiality principle  of future regulation. The material sustainability topics with the highest degree of  influence on our business activities and the generation of  lasting value are climate protection and sustainable product  design and lifecycle management. 2.1 Materiality assessment"}, {"knowledge": "Result of the materiality assessment We identified 15 material sustainability topics of the greatest  relevance to Siemens from both perspectives. \u201cWaste and  hazardous substance management\u201d and \u201cEmployee develop- ment\u201d were determined in fiscal 2023 to be two additional  material topics.

Siemens actively participates in several sustainability ratings  to provide our capital markets and our customers with robust  information and support the comparability and transparency  of our sustainability performance. Ratings also give us  important insights that assist in our continuous improvement.  We focus primarily on the six ratings summarized below. Siemens continues to achieve strong results in external   sustainability ratings in fiscal 2023, confirming our leading  position in the industry. ESG ratings in fiscal 2023 The MSCI ESG Rating scores global companies on a scale of  AAA (leader) to CCC (laggard) based on exposure to industry-  specific ESG risks and the ability to manage those risks rela- tive to peers. In fiscal 2023, Siemens was given an overall  MSCI ESG rating score of AA. In addition, Siemens is a member  of the MSCI World ESG Index. The ISS ESG Corporate Rating evaluates companies\u2019 ESG-  related risks, opportunities, and impacts along the corporate  value chain. Companies are rated from D- to A+ on their  sustainability performance based on an absolute best-in- class standard. For ISS ESG, Siemens again received prime  2.4Sustainability ratings reflect our performance status and a B rating, the best rating in our industry (Industrial  Conglomerates). Prime status recognizes companies for  being one of the leaders in their respective industry. Sustainalytics Sustainalytics\u2019 ESG Risk Ratings measure a company\u2019s expo- sure to industry-specific material ESG risks and how well a  company is managing those risks. In 2023, we were once  again rated as one of the leading companies in our industry  (Industrial Conglomerates) with a risk rating of 28.4 points  (Medium Risk). S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA)/ Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) The S&P Global CSA is an annual evaluation of companies\u2019  sustainability practices. The CSA focuses on sustainability  criteria that are both industry-specific and financially material.  In fiscal 2023, Siemens again ranks second among our  industry peers (Industrial Conglomerates) with a score of  81/100. Siemens has been listed in the Dow Jones Sustain- ability World Index (DJSI World) for over 20 years. EcoVadis EcoVadis provides supplier sustainability ratings for global  supply chains. Siemens received 77 points on its scorecard in  2023, placing it among the top 1% of all companies assessed  by EcoVadis in our industry. Thanks to this rating, Siemens is  being awarded the EcoVadis Gold medal. CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs a global disclosure  system that helps investors, companies, cities, states, and  regions manage their environmental impacts.

Siemens and its roughly 320,000  employees operate in multiple countries around the world.  Our customers in both the private and public sectors serve a  vast array of industries. Our global business operations are  governed by numerous national legal systems and take place  in a variety of political, social, and cultural settings that are  constantly changing. Therefore, Siemens\u2019 business and  compliance environment is correspondingly complex. The way that Siemens and our partners do business impacts  the markets and societies where we operate. Unethical and  unlawful conduct like corruption, cartel arrangements, and  money laundering can distort competition, hinder economic  development, and threaten human rights and democracy. As  a global player, Siemens is responsible for setting an example  in all its operations and in collaboration with all its stake- holders. By building alliances against corruption and pro- moting fair competition together with stakeholders from  politics, business, and society, Siemens can through Collec- tive Action help establish the conditions for fair competition  and thereby promote innovation.  Under certain circumstances, Siemens can be held liable for  the illegal activities of third parties: for example, business  partners acting as suppliers, intermediaries, resellers, and  consortium partners. Transactions conducted by business  partners can be misused to gain undue advantages for the  business partner or for Siemens.  3.1Compliance and ethics Our Compliance governance and policies  The Siemens Compliance organization oversees our compli- ance system and is chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer,  who is responsible for all legal and operational aspects of  compliance. The Compliance organization is part of Siemens  global Legal and Compliance department. It is led by the  General Counsel, who reports directly to our President and  Siemens Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to  Siemens\u2019 CEO on functional matters, in addition to reporting  to the Managing Board and the Siemens AG Supervisory  Board on a quarterly and ad-hoc basis.  Compliance Officers in the business ensure that our Compli- ance system is implemented worldwide. They work closely  with employees and managers, who assume personal  responsibility for compliance in their respective business  units. We believe that it is necessary for the entire management  team to act on our commitment to compliance and ensure  that all business decisions and transactions that fall within  their area of responsibility comply with both the relevant  legal requirements and our own values and company guide- lines.  At Siemens, we take a zero-tolerance approach to corruption  and other breaches of applicable laws and of our Business  Conduct Guidelines (BCGs).  Our BCGs contain the behavioral principles and rules that  guide our conduct, both within Siemens and in our stake- holder relationships. They also serve as an expression of our  values and lay the foundation for detailed internal regula- tions. The BCGs are binding for all Siemens employees  around the world. 3.1 Compliance and ethics"}, {"knowledge": "We also believe that acting on the basis of our Ethical Princi- ples allows us to focus even more on responsible business  practices. We aspire to support the sustainable development  of Siemens and the societies where we operate by adhering  to responsible business practices.  Worldwide commitment to fighting corruption  In collaboration with other international and national orga- nizations, we are committed to fighting corruption and   promoting fair competition in our markets and beyond.  This approach is also reflected in our Collective Action   activities, which includes our commitment to:  \u2192 The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  \u2192 The World Economic Forum and its Partnering Against  Corruption Initiative (PACI) \u2192 The United Nations Convention Against Corruption and  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD)\u2019s Anti-Bribery Convention  \u2192 The implementation of these conventions as part of   Business 20 (B20) The Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD  Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and other key  guidelines are embedded in our BCGs and provide a founda- tion and direction for all our activities.  BUSINESS CONDUCT  \u201cWe help our customers and partners around the world drive their digital and sustainable transformation. Without excuses or exceptions, we always act ethically, legally, and with the highest integrity.\u201d CEO Roland Busch The Siemens compliance system The goal of compliance at Siemens is to ensure that our  worldwide business practices follow the applicable laws and  comply with the BCGs. Our Compliance organization covers  the following activity fields: \u2192 Anti-corruption \u2192 Anti-money laundering \u2192 Anti-trust \u2192 Data privacy \u2192 Human rights \u2192 Export control To ensure compliance throughout the company, the Siemens  comprehensive compliance system is based on the three  pillars of prevention, detection, and response. Preventive measures include compliance risk management,  preparing topic-specific guidelines and procedures, incorpo- rating compliance requirements into business processes, our  Collective Action activities, and providing comprehensive  training and advice to our people.  In addition, protected channels for reporting compliance  violations like the \u201cTell Us\u201d whistle-blower system, the  Ombudsperson, and professional and fair investigations are  indispensable for identifying and resolving matters of indi- vidual misconduct. Our reporting channels also allow our  people to submit reports anonymously. We believe that transparent communication and clear conse- quences help reduce and resolve incidents of individual  misconduct. Our internal audit department also continuously  performs compliance controls and audits to ensure that our  compliance system is put into action and meets our world- wide requirements. 3.1 Compliance and ethics"}, {"knowledge": "Ethics management at Siemens In our business activities, we are committed to going beyond  laws and regulations. Our BCGs define how we interpret our  responsibility, what is expected of all employees, and how  we act as a company. Our ethical principles have been integrated in the updated  version of our BCGs. Responsible business conduct with all  stakeholders and consistent consideration of Ethical Principles  are expected in our decisions and are becoming increasingly  important in view of the many changes and challenges in the  world. Accordingly, we firmly anchored them in our BCGs: \u2192 We are honest and truthful in our dealings \u2192 We respect the dignity, privacy, and inherent rights of  individuals \u2192 We protect the health, occupational safety, and personal  security of our people \u2192 We act in line with our responsibility for the environment \u2192 We engage with reputable and law-abiding partners \u2192 We explore ethical concerns We are committed to fulfilling these requirements in all our  actions and decisions. In the complex environment of the  global economy, \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d is not always easy.  Our new Siemens BCG training helps us to better assess   situations in our work environment and make the right  decisions. We believe that by acting responsibly beyond laws  and regulations, we can continue achieving Siemens\u2019 success  in collaboration with our business partners. Ethical standards for artificial intelligence Siemens prioritizes ethical standards and responsible busi- ness conduct in the digital world; specifically, by protecting  data, mitigating biases, supporting data sovereignty, and  ensuring trustworthy and responsible AI. We implement  safeguards for transparency, accountability, technical  robustness, security, and safety while promoting fairness  and accessibility.

This includes: \u2192 Applying generally accepted and trustworthy AI frameworks  to AI tools in anticipation of the upcoming AI regulation  in the EU.  \u2192 Raising awareness and providing guidance to employees  and stakeholders on ethical implications in AI decision-  making. Collaboration with business partners Each Siemens department is responsible for its own business  partners. They must be carefully selected by the responsible  operational department and must undergo a risk-based  compliance due diligence process. Business partners have to  be adequately monitored for the duration of the business  relationship. This means that we regularly assess the need  for the continued relationship and provision of services,  taking into account remuneration and other relevant circum- stances.  We have established mandatory processes and the associ- ated tools for this purpose that are continuously refined to  cover any risks that may arise. Decisions about engaging a business partner are transparent  and risk-oriented. They are also based on the most recent  compliance due diligence procedures. Appropriate remediation  measures are initiated depending on the risk classification of  the business relationship and the risks identified. Both business partners and suppliers are required to sign a  code of conduct. In addition, depending on their risk classi- fication, audits can be conducted on the business partners\u2019  premises by the Siemens audit function or external service  providers.  SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES To support the compliance experts on business partner topics,  Siemens established the Business Partners Network. This  network operates in different workstreams, some of which  are connected with specific projects and others that are  related to specific questions on the subject of collaboration  with business partners. Preventing money laundering and terrorism financing Siemens strives to only maintain business relationships with  reputable customers, suppliers, partners, and companies  whose business activities comply with legal requirements  and whose financial resources are of legitimate origin. We  use a risk-based approach to verify the identity and economic  background of customers, suppliers, business partners, and  other third parties and the origin of payments to ensure they  come from legitimate sources. When necessary, Siemens  reports suspicious activities to law enforcement authorities. Handling of compliance cases  At Siemens, compliance cases are handled in accordance  with a clearly structured process that includes key steps such  as reporting channels, internal investigations, and responses  to identified violations (see the diagram below). Company-wide process for handling compliance cases (simplified presentation) Allegation received Assessment  carried out by examining or evaluating the allegation before mandating an investigation Disciplinary measures and remediation MandatingResearch  and planningInvestigationPreparation of  the investigation report Compliance  investigation 3.1 Compliance and ethics"}, {"knowledge": "Siemens offers a range of reporting channels to enable all  employees and outside third parties to flag potential compli- ance violations to the company. For instance, complaints can  be reported by way of the protected whistle-blower system  \u201cTell Us\u201d or to the independent Siemens Ombudsperson.  Reports received through these channels are forwarded to  our Compliance organization. Complaints can also be  reported directly to the Compliance Officers in our business  units or to the senior management. Whistle-blowers at  Siemens are protected by national laws and also by internal  company regulations that prohibit the punishment or other  detrimental treatment of anyone who reports a suspicious  activity in good faith.  Every complaint is taken seriously. If the allegations prove to  be sufficiently plausible, the Compliance organization deter- mines whether there is sufficient information to justify an  internal investigation. Indications about other matters are  forwarded to the affected Siemens department or business  unit for further action. Internal investigations are conducted based on binding,  clearly defined standards to ensure the fair and respectful  treatment of employees. These standards prohibit unlawful  or disproportionate actions. However, if an internal investiga- tion leads to the finding that an employee has demonstrably  violated any laws or internal regulations, they can expect  appropriate disciplinary consequences. All circumstances within a compliance case, including the  locally applicable legal environment and any participation  rights of the competent employee representative bodies, are  duly considered during the proceedings.  Affected Siemens entities are obligated to implement the  additional recommendations of the investigation reports,  including measures to effectively remedy the situation. Compliance risk management To be effective, the Siemens compliance system needs to be  continuously adjusted in order to meet business-specific  risks and multiple local legal requirements. The findings  from compliance risk assessments, along with compliance  controls and audits, help us identify opportunities to further  develop the compliance system. The goal of compliance risk management is to detect compli- ance risks early and take appropriate steps to prevent or  mitigate risks. Risk assessments and tool solutions that   support risk evaluations are also integrated into individual  business processes to support our employees in taking  appropriate risk mitigation steps. Compliance risk management is an integral part of the   company-wide Siemens Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)  program  SIEMENS FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL 2023, COMBINED  MANAGEMENT REPORT, 8.3.1 STRATEGIC RISKS, which provides a  holistic view of all identified risks throughout the Group.  Every entity and region assesses their business risks in rela- tion to compliance risks. Current developments are also  systematically evaluated. As a core part of our risk management process, we collabo- rate closely with relevant business units to identify and  assess compliance risks within new digital business models.  Continuous Compliance Risk Management implements a  bottom-up evaluation of the local risk environment in each  of Siemens\u2019 entities on a worldwide basis in all activity fields  defined by Compliance. CEOs, business leaders, Compliance  Officers, and experts from every entity meet during the fiscal  year to identify and assess compliance risks.1 The risks iden- tified are then aggregated and presented during annual  Compliance Risk and Performance Reviews to the Compli- ance Management Council. The risks are documented in the  Compliance Risk Tracking tool. Additional information from internal data sources is included  to provide a holistic overview of compliance risks. Cross-  functional knowledge exchanges take place at regular  meetings, and an annual Corporate Compliance Risk Work- shop helps us identify and monitor emerging or changing  risks. The results of the risk assessments are a key starting  point for the ongoing development of our compliance system. 1 At SHS, formal Compliance Risk Assessments are conducted every three years, with the last being performed in fiscal 2023. 3.1 Compliance and ethics"}, {"knowledge": "Targets Our ethics approach is also embedded in our DEGREE   sustainability framework within the field of action Ethics. Actions and results Progress in fiscal 2023 In fiscal 2023, we continued to make progress with our  Siemens compliance system, including: \u2192 Enhancing our integrated risk management approach  with updated technology to better continuously monitor  and update risks. This enables us to rapidly adapt to   factors like emerging risks, business transformation, and  changing regulatory and geopolitical conditions. \u2192 We are transforming and modernizing the technology  that supports our compliance management system in  order to keep pace with the digital transformation of our  company. This includes our new cloud-based solutions,  which we have leveraged to further streamline and auto- mate our risk-based compliance processes and support  data-driven holistic risk management and continuous  control activities. With these cloud-based solutions, we  aim to improve assurance and efficiency of compliance  activities at Siemens. Compliance training To ensure that compliance and integrity are embedded  throughout the organization, Siemens employees and the  Compliance organization receive targeted, group-oriented,  risk-based training on compliance topics. Our employees learn through mandatory web-based train- ings and non-mandatory learning products about compli- ance topics and on the content of our BCGs. We train all our  employees (full-time and part-time) worldwide. Employers  of external employees are contractually obligated to comply  with the Supplier Code of Conduct and must ensure compli- ance by external employees as part of the onboarding pro- cess  We strive to train every employee worldwide on the BCGs in  a recurring three-year cycle, according to the Ethics DEGREE  target. The new three-year cycle started in fiscal 2023. In  July 2023, the rollout of an update to our BCG web-based  training began, which now includes our Ethical Principles.  Our learning management system SABA tracks the mandatory  training courses. The completion of training requirements is  visible in our SABA dashboard, and detail reporting is available  for the management on demand. In addition, materials are regularly offered through the  Integrity Dialog initiative. With this initiative, managers have  an opportunity to discuss and raise awareness of current  compliance topics with their teams. Progress on DEGREE ambition #3: Striving to train 100% of our people on the Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines every three years As part of the DEGREE sustainability framework,  Siemens has set itself the ambition of training all  employees on BCGs in a three-year cycle. The current  cycle started in fiscal 2023. By end of this fiscal year the  new BCG training \u201cDoing the right thing!\u201d has been  rolled out to 71% of all active employees worldwide  with a current KPI result of 69% newly trained employees  in this cycle.

More information on significant ongoing and future charges  of corruption, antitrust violations, and other violations of the  law can be found in  SIEMENS REPORT FOR FISCAL 2023, COMBINED  Stakeholder involvement in our compliance approach Compliance-related questions are included in the annual  Siemens Global Employee Survey in order to evaluate the  effectiveness of the compliance system within the company.  We also use the survey to acquire a better understanding of  the degree to which ethical conduct is embedded in our  corporate culture. The results of last year\u2019s survey show an  increase in the already high approval rates3 relative to the  perception and awareness of integrity, ethics, and responsible  business conduct throughout the organization.  2 This figure includes Siemens Healthineers employees. 3 At the same time, the overall response rates decreased from 167,900 in fiscal 2022 to 161,550 in fiscal 2023. 129,000 employees were trained on the content of our BCGs in fiscal 2023 Siemens employees around the world also completed about  461,000 training programs for specific target groups in fiscal  2023.2 \u201cEthical corporate governance and compliance are non\u00adnegotiable. Our approach goes beyond strict compliance with laws and regulations by placing integrity at the center of our corporate culture and business processes.\u201d CEO Roland Busch Compliance indicators and whistle-blowers Our employees use our reporting channels regularly. A total  of 416 compliance cases that required an inquiry or investi- gation were reported in fiscal 2023. We believe that the  increase in compliance cases from the previous year falls  within the range of normal fluctuation. The total number of  disciplinary measures imposed for compliance violations was  166 in fiscal 2023. The number of disciplinary measures in a fiscal year does not  necessarily reflect the number of compliance cases reported  in the same period. This is because disciplinary action may  not be taken in the same year as the case was reported or  when the investigation was completed. Furthermore, one  compliance case may result in multiple disciplinary actions  or none at all. 3.1 Compliance and ethics"}, {"knowledge": "Collective Action and the Siemens Integrity Initiative We believe that in order for substantial progress to be made  in combating corruption and fostering fair competition,  large numbers of stakeholders must act collectively.  The Siemens global Integrity Initiative earmarks more than  US$100 million to support organizations and projects that  combat corruption and fraud through Collective Action,  education, and training.  The Siemens Integrity Initiative focuses on supporting proj- ects that have a clear impact on the business environment,  can demonstrate objective and measurable results, and have  the potential to be scaled up and replicated. So far, we have allocated approximately US$120 million for  85 projects in more than 50 countries across all funding  rounds. Detailed information on this subject is provided in  the Siemens Integrity Initiative\u2019s annual reports.

We are unreservedly committed to safeguarding  and respecting human rights in every stage of the value  chain. We understand this to be a key element of acting with  integrity and responsible business conduct.  The way we function in our own operations, in our supply  chain, and in our downstream value chain may affect the  economic development and advancement of society.  Siemens takes a holistic approach to respecting human  rights. We strive to continuously assess actual and potential  adverse impacts on people and the environment and inte- grate our findings in our company\u2019s policies, procedures, and  due diligence practices. Therefore, our commitment to  respecting human rights is an integral part of our manage- ment systems and is embedded across company functions  and business operations globally. Management and responsibilities The Siemens Managing Board and the Siemens Sustainability  Board (SSB) monitor Siemens\u2019 actions in relation to human  rights and our commitment to implementing the United  Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  These bodies review our progress and our challenges and  identify opportunities for improvement.  The Chief Compliance Officer, also appointed to serve as the  Siemens Human Rights Officer by the Managing Board of  Siemens AG, reports to the Supervisory Board and Managing  Board on a regular and ad hoc basis on issues concerning  human rights: for example, the German Supply Chain Due  Diligence Act (LkSG), for which Legal Compliance is the  overarching coordination body. The SSB has assigned overall responsibility for human rights  to the Siemens Sustainability and Compliance departments.  Their primary task is to proactively and systematically ensure  that respect for human rights is deeply embedded in our  company-wide processes and decision-making. To achieve  this, both departments regularly assess opportunities for  improvement in accordance with international standards.  The Supply Chain, People and Organization, Environment,  Health and Safety, Corporate Security, and Siemens Real  Estate departments are responsible for embedding and  maintaining human rights-related due diligence require- ments within their processes. This responsibility also includes  the conceptualization and delivery of training and continuous  learning formats. Commitment to human rights and international standards The principle of respect for human rights is firmly grounded  in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop- ment. Siemens believes that the 17 Sustainability Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) can only be fully achieved if potentially  negative impacts within the value chains are examined in  detail and effective action is taken to counter them. In these  efforts, we are guided by international standards that help  companies define their approaches to human rights and  continuously optimize them. These standards include the  United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human  Rights and the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises   published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD). They highlight the importance of  due diligence systems that proactively identify, assess, and  mitigate potential adverse human rights impacts. 3.2 Human rights"}, {"knowledge": "The Business Conduct Guidelines  Our commitment to respecting human rights is anchored in our  Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs)  COMPLIANCE  AND ETHICS. They set out the fundamental principles and rules  that apply to our actions relating to human rights in our  company and with our customers, external partners, and the  public. The BCGs are binding for all employees worldwide. In  addition, the Siemens Group Code of Conduct for Suppliers  and Third-Party Intermediaries (Supplier Code of Conduct),  which is mainly focused on rules of conduct relating to  human rights, applies to the company\u2019s suppliers, third-party  intermediaries, and business partners. Beyond that, Siemens has reaffirmed its commitment to  workers\u2019 fundamental labor rights in an International Frame- work Agreement signed with trade unions and employee  representatives in 2012. This specifically includes the right  to collective bargaining and freedom of association. Targets Our DEGREE sustainability framework consists of a number  of fields of actions that address the multifaceted issue of  human rights in the areas of G (Governance), E (Ethics),  E (Employability), and E (Equity).1 Regarding our approach to respecting human rights, we have  established measures that encompass our own operations, our  supply chain, and customer-related business activities. Continuous improvement measures We view fulfilling our responsibility to human rights as a  continuous improvement journey. In fiscal 2023, Siemens  modified its policies, processes, and methods to align with  regulatory requirements like the LkSG. We have established  a cross-functional Committee with the aim of ensuring gov- ernance oversight and decision-making on future measures  related to the LkSG. In consideration of future regulatory developments and  increased stakeholder expectations, we strive to continu- ously modify the company\u2019s risk management programs and  procedures across our value chain.  We aim to systematically identify and assess the risk of  human rights violations at an early stage and to mitigate  them responsibly to the extent that they can be influenced  by the company. Actions and results Human rights in our own workforce The BCGs are an integral element of all employment con- tracts.  BUSINESS CONDUCT GUIDELINES. Siemens does not tolerate  discrimination, sexual harassment, or any other form of  personal attack on individuals or groups. In addition, the  principles of equal opportunity and equal treatment apply  without restriction. We foster diversity, equal opportunity,  and inclusion in the interest of creating an open and   welcoming work environment.  DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION Human rights in the supply chain One of our guiding principles is to maintain sustainable  supply chains. Siemens\u2019 suppliers commit to upholding the  Supplier Code of Conduct, which affirms the fundamental  human rights of our suppliers\u2019 employees. In fiscal 2023, we  modified the Supplier Code of Conduct to include additional  requirements from new regulations and prepared its rollout  readiness for fiscal 2024. The Code encompasses but is not limited to the following  human rights topics: \u2192 Fair work conditions (pay, work hours, vacations) \u2192 Right to freedom of association \u2192 Responsibility for health and safety standards \u2192 Prohibition of discrimination \u2192 Prohibition of forced labor and child labor \u2192 Provision of anonymous grievance mechanisms Siemens takes a risk-based approach to identifying potential  risks in its supply chain. This includes Corporate Responsibility  Self-Assessments (CRSAs) by suppliers and external sustain- ability audits. When deviations from the Supplier Code of  Conduct and violations of the human rights principles are  identified, we work with suppliers to clarify how lasting  corrective actions can be taken within a reasonable time- frame.  SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES  In the case of severe violations, we reserve the right to   terminate the supplier relationship.

Human rights in customer-related business  Siemens is committed to operationalizing systematic and  preventive human rights due diligence along its value chain.  This is also applicable to downstream due diligence with a  focus on customer-related business. We are strengthening our governance with regards to envi- ronmental, social, and human rights due diligence in   customer-related business through targeted capacity-building,  continuous due diligence tool-related enhancements (in our  ESG Risk Due Diligence Tool, the ESG Radar), expanding   relevant risk indicators for risk oversight creation, embedding  environmental and social risk considerations in the company\u2019s  risk management processes, and strengthening risk mitigation  pathways with the support of external human rights expertise.  We are also enhancing our control mechanisms with a   primary focus on our business sales department and contin- uously reassessing material areas of adverse impacts \u2013 for  example, those resulting from certain business fields \u2013 so  that they can be embedded in our due diligence systems. The early detection of  environmental   and social risks plays a key role   in human rights due diligence. 3.2 Human rights"}, {"knowledge": "These initiatives have been incorporated into our internal  guidelines and policies. They have also led to the creation of  customized roles and responsibilities within our key functions,  our businesses, and our regions. As part of our commitment  to responsible business conduct, we have piloted the process  of environmental, social, and human rights deep-dive due  diligence that will be conducted annually for established key  business partners and strategic partners. This process has  been piloted in fiscal 2023 and will become mandatory  beginning in fiscal 2024. Material human rights risks that we have identified in our  value chain are summarized in the table below. Compliance, and Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS). In  fiscal 2023, we revised the mandatory BCG training for our  people and included specifics on fundamental rights at work. External and internal expert dialogs and regular knowledge-  sharing are also conducted in the area of environmental  and social risks: for example, on responsible business due  diligence in conflict regions. Grievance mechanism and channels Siemens offers protected channels for reporting violations of  external and internal rules to all our people and external  third parties. The reports generated by these channels are  forwarded to our Compliance organization and followed up.  The same channels can also be used to report human rights  violations to the company.  COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS Networks and coalitions We maintain a regular dialog with our peers, and we aim to  establish mutual trust and drive a more in-depth discussion  on human rights. This kind of dialog focuses on discussing  challenges and solutions, addressing areas of improvement  with regard to responsible business conduct practices, and  identifying potential areas to join forces. We firmly believe  that we can achieve faster, more impactful progress through  collective action compared to acting alone. Siemens is a member of the Global Business Initiative on  Human Rights (GBI). This initiative is one of the leading  international network initiatives in the field of human rights.  Siemens is also represented in the UN Global Compact Net- work\u2019s European Business and Human Rights Peer Learning  Group. In Germany, Siemens is involved in econsense2  working groups in the areas of business and human rights  and human rights in the supply chain. In addition to regular dialogs with peers and think tanks,   we engage with external human rights advisors to derive  responsible risk mitigation pathways, training and capacity-  building methods, and ways to strengthen due diligence  practices. In addition, we engage with investors, sharehold- ers, customers, journalists, rating agencies, and NGOs.

We work with approximately 67,700 suppliers in  around 140 countries. In fiscal 2023, Siemens purchased  goods and services valued at just under \u20ac37 billion, the  equivalent of about half of our total revenue. Due to the  varying conditions in these countries, ensuring strict compli- ance with our globally applicable sustainability requirements  poses a significant challenge for our daily procurement  practices. Our purchasing activities have impacts on our suppliers,  local communities, and the environment in our procurement  markets. As such, we monitor and engage with our suppliers  to drive and support their efforts to enhance sustainability  practices. Our supplier relationships provide us with the  opportunity to make contributions to securing jobs and  promoting adherence to both international work and envi- ronmental standards. Using our holistic sustainable supply  chain management approach, we work to prevent situations  where suppliers may be tempted to compromise the well-  being of their workforce or violate environmental regulations. Siemens purchased goods and  services worth \u20ac37 billion from  about 140 countries Our governance and policies for strategic procurement The core objectives of the strategic procurement processes are  to sustain the company\u2019s success by making a consistently high  contribution to our earnings from purchases of materials and  services, to assert high quality standards along the entire  supply chain, to identify and exploit opportunities to create  value through procurement competence, and to ensure   compliance and sustainability. Sustainability is our guiding  principle. The sustainability initiatives we take are an essential  aspect of the successful implementation of our programs. Our  understanding of sustainability in the supply chain is based on  our company values to be responsible, excellent and innova- tive. As a Support Function in the Service and Governance  units, Siemens Supply Chain Management has the process and  regulation responsibilities for procurement principles. Our mandated purchasing units take general responsibility  for implementing and complying with Siemens\u2019 procurement  principles. Therefore, only mandated purchasing units are  authorized to conclude contracts with suppliers.  We have developed policies that describe our standards for  suppliers in terms of their social, environmental, and ethical  performance. They lay the foundation for guiding supplier  selection, evaluation, and ongoing engagement. The Siemens Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Third-Party  Intermediaries (Supplier Code of Conduct) is designed to  cover our sustainability requirements. Among other princi- ples, it is based on the principles outlined in the United  Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and our Business Conduct  Guidelines (BCGs), which sets out the basic principles of  sustainability for our suppliers. The Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers to adhere to  standards on: \u2192 Fundamental rights of employees, including a protected  grievance mechanism for employees \u2192 Health, safety, and environmental protection 3.3 Sustainable supply chain practices"}, {"knowledge": "Progress on DEGREE ambition #2: Net Zero supply chain by 2050,  20% emissions reduction by 2030 In fiscal 2023, supply chain emissions decreased by  1% compared to the baseline year 2020, reaching  8,029 kt CO2e, with the carbon reduction measures  implemented by our suppliers being reflected in this  number. If the increase in purchasing volume of  around 33% is included, CO2e emissions were however  reduced even further in relation to the purchasing  volume. Progress Siemens without SHS Progress on DEGREE ambition #4: ESG-secured supply chain based on  supplier commitment to our Supplier Code of Conduct We expect our suppliers not only to contribute to the  economic success of our company but also to ensure  strict compliance with our sustainability require- ments, which are summarized in the Siemens Supplier  Code of Conduct.

GGovernance DDecarbonization 3.3 Sustainable supply chain practices"}, {"knowledge": "The supplier management process at Siemens incorporates  strict criteria for supplier selection and qualification. When  engaging with new suppliers, we categorize and if necessary  proactively address potential sustainability risks based on  these criteria. This may apply to suppliers exhibiting the   following risk characteristics: \u2192 Locations in high-risk countries \u2192 Products subject to the requirements for the responsible  sourcing of minerals \u2192 Products and services with large carbon footprints To identify these risk characteristics, we categorize our   suppliers as follows: \u2192 Purchased material and service fields: We classify suppliers  based on the specific types of materials and services they  provide. This allows us to tailor our measures to individual  suppliers: for example, incorporating specific contract  clauses, requesting proof of compliance, or flagging them  for on-site audits. \u2192 Country risk levels: Suppliers are assigned to risk levels  based on country-specific sustainability indicators in  areas like legal compliance, corruption and bribery,  human rights in the workplace, and child labor. We centralize sustainability-related data about our suppliers  on the SCM Sustainability Platform, which enables us to  gather information from diverse internal and external sources.  This includes data on carbon reduction initiatives, corporate  responsibility self-assessments (CRSA), on-site audit results,  and risks associated with conflict minerals. All employees in  Siemens\u2019 purchasing departments can access this integrated  tool. Information is evaluated in the platform using a point system  and is presented visually. This uniform assessment approach  enables sustainability to serve as a consistent evaluation  factor throughout Siemens. It supports and complements  local purchasing decisions with globally available supplier  sustainability information.  Self-assessments and site audits as control mechanisms Based on the risk categories, we conduct appropriate evalu- ations of suppliers in accordance with our risk assessment.  These reviews range from supplier self-assessments of their  own sustainability practices to on-site sustainability audits  conducted by external auditors. Corporate Responsibility Self\u00adAssessments CRSAs are an integral part of our supplier qualification pro- cess. They are subject to regular review and updates to align  them with evolving standards and regulations. As part of this  process, potential suppliers undergo a mandatory qualifica- tion procedure, while existing suppliers are re-assessed  every three years.  The number of completed CRSAs increased by about 4% from  4,912 in fiscal 2022 to 5,096 in fiscal 2023. The number of  agreed-upon improvement measures increased in fiscal 2023  to 5,493, as compared to the 3,109 reported in fiscal 2022.

We slightly increased the number of external sustainability  audits compared to fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, the figure  rose by about 13% to 481 audits. This figure includes  13 audits that we conducted virtually, where the auditor  inspected the suppliers\u2019 facilities by remote video. Also  included are four audits verified by our audit service provider  that were conducted on behalf of third parties at companies  that also have supplier relationships with Siemens. These  audit reports fully comply with Siemens\u2019 requirements and  were provided to us with the approval of the audited companies. We also may repeat audits or conduct follow-up audits  through our external audit service provider. Our responsible  purchasing departments at Siemens can also agree on a  series of improvement measures with suppliers. In fiscal  2023, improvement measures were agreed on to address a  variety of potential social impacts. These impacts include  human rights and the health and safety of employees as well  as environmental impacts like a lack of certification and  failure to reduce CO2e emissions. During this process, we remain committed to our supplier  partnerships, and we work to help them improve. However,  if problems persist, or the supplier demonstrates a lack of  willingness to take the necessary corrective actions, we  remove them from our supplier list.  Suppliers can also be blocked in local systems around the  world via our IT-based Global Master Data Management  process for suppliers. Sustainability topics with a specific need for action  Two focus topics play an important role in our sustainable  supply chain practices, given their strong connection to  other sustainability initiatives at Siemens. These include the  responsible sourcing of minerals and reducing CO2e emis- sions in our supply chain. Responsible sourcing of minerals Siemens is working hard to prevent the use of minerals from  areas of conflict, and high-risk areas in the supply chain that  are covered by the risk definition set out in Annex 2 of the  OECD\u2019s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply  Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk  Areas. To support the responsible sourcing of minerals, we  developed the Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy, which  is integrated into our purchasing process. This policy sets a  uniform standard for supply chain management across the  company. Our approach aligns with the risk-based require- ments of the OECD\u2019s Due Diligence Guidance. To determine the use, sources, and origins of these minerals  in our supply chains, we investigate the smelting plants  involved. Siemens is a member of the Responsible Minerals  Initiative (RMI), an organization of more than 400 industrial  companies that provide auditing programs for smelting. We  use the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) published  by the RMI to survey our more than 2,300 relevant suppliers  and elicit the information we need about smelters in our  3.3 Sustainable supply chain practices"}, {"knowledge": "supply chain that are associated with the production of tin,  tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG).

Siemens  conducts supplier audits for cobalt and mica, with a particular  focus on battery manufacturers.  More information and the text of our Responsible Minerals  Sourcing Policy can be found at  WWW.SIEMENS.COM/  Our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program In our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program, we collaborate  with an external partner to analyze the economic data and  model the carbon footprint of each of our suppliers. To  facilitate this process, we utilize a web-based tool called  supplier+s that highlights the main sources of suppliers\u2019  CO2e emissions and provides guidance on how to reduce  them. Once suppliers have completed the learning phase,  they provide us with their primary data through the tool. Supplier+s is based on the following methodology: \u2192 Suppliers are categorized into product or service categories  and country of origin and are then assigned an industry  average for CO2e emissions based on the calculation  model developed by our external partner.  \u2192 We ask our suppliers to provide information via supplier+s  about their implemented CO2e reduction measures and  their overall CO2e management. Based on their responses,  we calculate the resulting emissions reduction and the  remaining carbon footprint of the supplier. Positive feedback on our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers pro- gram encouraged us to open the formerly internal tool (CWA  Carbon Web Assessment) to external use by other companies  in the form of the supplier+s tool. Detailed information on  supplier+s is provided at  WWW.SIEMENS.COM/CARBON\u00adSUPPLIERS. 4,324 suppliers \u2013 who stand for 43% of our Scope 3 upstream  (tier 1) footprint \u2013 have provided us with primary data by  taking part in our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program.  2,038 of them have shared their decarbonization plans with  us by joining the supplier+s platform, which was launched in  fiscal 2023. Based on the responses we received and calcu- lated, there was an average reduction of 9% in the previously   calculated emissions for these suppliers, equivalent to a  decrease of 464,000 metric tons of CO2e. This indicates that  our suppliers have been more supportive in reducing our  carbon footprint in the supply chain compared to the previous  year\u2019s reduction of 359,000 metric tons of CO2e. This effort  helped reduce our Siemens Scope 3 upstream footprint  against our baseline year 2020 by 0.9% and against the  previous year 2022 by 3.3%.1 1 Siemens without SHS 3.3 Sustainable supply chain practices"}, {"knowledge": "3.4 Cybersecurity and data privacy  \u2013 Leading role in cybersecurity\u2013 Global expertise and governance structures We believe that data protection is an integral part of respon- sible business conduct. Cybersecurity and data privacy are  key success factors for Siemens, and for digitalization in  general. While data privacy practices cover personal data  from a legal perspective, cybersecurity focuses on protecting  products, solutions, and services, information technology  (IT), and operational technology (OT). Our primary objective  is to maintain strong data protection and a high level of  cybersecurity for the company and all our stakeholders. Cybersecurity Management approach Cybersecurity is rapidly growing in importance Digital systems have become indispensable in many sectors  of the economy: for instance, in hospitals, factories, smart  buildings, e-mobility, and connected mobility. Wherever  sensitive data are stored, potential security threats are never  far away. As a result, cybersecurity is one of today\u2019s most  relevant issues, not just for companies but for society as a  whole. Its relevance is only expected to increase, with cyber- security becoming crucial for helping businesses safeguard  critical infrastructures, protect sensitive information, and  ensure business continuity. As one of Siemens\u2019 strategic goals, the digital transformation  will only succeed if Siemens can be certain that connected  systems and the data contained within them will remain  secure. That is why Siemens places the highest priority on  cybersecurity. Siemens\u2019 products, solutions, and services contain a signifi- cant amount of software and IT-related components and are  often used in the context of critical infrastructures \u2013 which  means that they can be more exposed to cyberthreats.   Regulatory- and customer-specific security requirements are  increasing, and Siemens needs to address them. Siemens takes a holistic approach to addressing cybersecurity  in the best interest of our customers. It is essential to the  comprehensive protection of both industry and society from  internal and external cyberattacks. Our cybersecurity governance and policies The Cybersecurity Board (CSB), chaired by the Global Chief  Cybersecurity Officer, is responsible for the implementation  and coordination of cybersecurity throughout Siemens. The  member of the Siemens AG Managing Board responsible for  cybersecurity is part of the CSB, as are the Chief Cybersecurity  Officers of each of Siemens\u2019 businesses.  Given the importance of cybersecurity for the senior man- agement, the Global Chief Cybersecurity Officer reports  directly to the responsible member of the Managing Board,  quarterly to the entire Managing Board, and annually to the  Supervisory Board. The CSB provides a collaborative platform for advancing  strategic initiatives that address security issues and establish  cybersecurity requirements and recommendations through- out Siemens and its affiliated companies. In addition, a   collaboration agreement enables the Chief Cybersecurity  Officer at Siemens Healthineers to participate in the CSB. Having recognized early on that cybersecurity is an integral  part of the digital revolution, Siemens built a cybersecurity  organization both at the corporate level and in the busi- nesses and countries. All information security rules and  regulations at Siemens are documented and detailed in the  Cybersecurity Policy Framework. The framework outlines the  roles and responsibilities and the rules and practices that  offer a guide for how Siemens and its business units protect  information and business processes. 3.4 Cybersecurity and data privacy"}, {"knowledge": "The Information Security Policies define the mandatory high- level requirements and general rules for information security.  The policies serve as blueprints for establishing and managing  information security at Siemens. The requirements are based  on the domains defined in Annex A of the international  standard ISO/IEC 27001. Siemens\u2019 cybersecurity governance  has been ISO 27001-certified since November 2017.  Our commitment to cybersecurity is further reinforced by  Siemens\u2019 participation in founding the \u201cCharter of Trust\u201d1  initiative to protect data and promote cybersecurity in a  trustworthy digital world.

Our  cybersecurity performance is highly regarded, as evidenced  by our sustainability ratings and rankings. For example, the  Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) has ranked Siemens as  a leading company in cybersecurity relative to our peers. Siemens products, solutions, and services Siemens is implementing a company-wide Product and  Solution Security (PSS) initiative. The objectives of the initia- tive are to formulate PSS recommendations and binding  requirements and to apply and continuously improve them  in all the businesses. The PSS initiative is managed by the PSS Maturity model, a  proprietary, standards-based model. It shows the extent to  which the established business and design processes are  being expanded and constantly improved in terms of their  security activities and requirements. Evaluations are per- formed annually at the organizational level, the results are  discussed with each unit\u2019s management team, and corre- sponding improvement programs are initiated. To further strengthen Siemens\u2019 cybersecurity business, our  businesses offer selected high-maturity security services to  external customers in collaboration with the Corporate  Cybersecurity department. Continuing education and young talent development In fiscal 2023, 95% of our employees completed the manda- tory cybersecurity awareness training. The training cycle  began in January 2023 and ran until the end of September  2023.  In addition, we offer the training \u201cDriver\u2019s License\u201d to a target  group of approximately 8,000 employees who are trained to  apply all of Siemens\u2019 IT/OT security guidelines. All of our  employees also have access to continually updated training  courses and learning opportunities on product and solution  security through My Learning World, the Siemens global  learning platform. 1 https://www.charteroftrust.com/.2 https://www.siemens.com/global/en/company/digital-transformation/cybersecurity/governance.html#SecondLineofDefense. 3.4 Cybersecurity and data privacy"}, {"knowledge": "Due to the growing demand for cybersecurity experts, we  launched the CyberMinds Academy in 2022. This is a world- wide one-year program that combines learning modules  with professional experience designed to develop young  talents into cybersecurity specialists. Cybersecurity insurance and risk analysis To protect the company and reduce the potential financial  impact of cyber incidents, we have explored risk transfer  options in detail. Following an international call for insurance  bids, the currently insurable cyber risks were transferred to a  group of insurers in fiscal 2021. The coverage emphasizes  losses caused by incidents such like as breaches of information  security and data privacy within Siemens or by third parties.  The scope and limits of the risk transfer to the insurance  market are reviewed annually. Siemens\u2019 Cybersecurity department has also acted to mitigate  risk even more. For example:  \u2192 As industrial environments become increasingly digi- talized, the share of software grows significantly, as does  the number of associated vulnerabilities. To mitigate  these risks, Siemens is automating the collection and  distribution of information about vulnerabilities with the  goal of offering end-to-end security for our customers.  These efforts include our collaboration with the Common  Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0 from the OASIS  Consortium \u2192 Since 2022, Siemens has been working intensively to  encrypt the most important data in the post-quantum  era. As part of this work, the previous crypto algorithms  have had be completely replaced with new methods.  Because it is our expectation that crypto algorithms will  need to be updated much more frequently in the future,  the project also addresses the encryption lifecycle in the  form of an expiration date for the classification of docu- ments. \u2192 Our Zero Trust initiative, whose motto is \u201cNever trust,  always verify,\u201d has been extended to fiscal 2024. The  objective is to check every internal and external connection  between IT/OT devices and products in real time and only  permit trustworthy communications. Proactive approach to handling threats and vulnerabilities, reactive approach to incidents Siemens CERT3 and Siemens ProductCERT are dedicated  teams of experienced security experts who can provide an  immediate response to potential security threats and   incidents affecting Siemens\u2019 products, solutions, services, or  infrastructure. Siemens CERT secures our internal infrastructure, continu- ously monitors cyberthreats, and evaluates their potential  impact on the company. When security incidents occur, our  experts analyze the causes and initiate countermeasures to  minimize harmful impacts, and the appropriate stakeholder  groups (and the authorities, if required) are informed.  Under the Special Vulnerability Handling program, CERT also  takes proactive steps to support a consistently high level of  protection by addressing potential vulnerabilities before any  damage occurs.  The ProductCERT team addresses security issues that affect  Siemens products and solutions. It is the central point of  contact for reports of security gaps in Siemens products. As  a key partner of the Siemens business units, the ProductCERT  team supports the entire process \u2013 from identification to  resolution of vulnerabilities \u2013 and provides crucial informa- tion to customers. Updated Siemens Security Advisories are  published on a monthly basis to ensure our level of transpar- ency. With the CSAF format, we are among the leading  industrial manufacturers for the automated distribution of  vulnerability information. In addition, our Vilocify Vulnerability Services4 continually  search for information about vulnerabilities in software and  hardware components used in Siemens\u2019 products and infra- structures. As a final step, product security must be guaranteed  by means of verification tests. To this end, we have developed  the Siemens Extensible Security Testing Application (SiESTA5),  which enables the dedicated identification of vulnerabilities  in infrastructures, products, and solutions. 3 Computer Emergency Response Team.4 https://www.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/digital-enterprise-services/industrial-security-services/vilocify-vulnerability-services.html.5 https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cybersecurity/siesta.html. 3.4 Cybersecurity and data privacy"}, {"knowledge": "Artificial intelligence in cybersecurity Artificial intelligence (AI) serves a crucial function in  Siemens\u2019 cybersecurity endeavors.

This action  taken against security breaches helps mitigate potential harm. AI also boosts the effectiveness of our cybersecurity proce- dures by automating day-to-day tasks. This automation  enables our security teams to concentrate on more intricate  and pressing issues. Despite the advantages, it is important to note that AI can  also be used as a tool of cyber attackers by enhancing the  complexity of their malicious actions. The attackers might  harness AI to automate their attacks, evade conventional  security systems, or even simulate human behavior to escape  detection.  To be well-prepared for these scenarios, we\u2019ve established  stringent security protocols aimed at ensuring a safe and  responsible application of AI. Our approach helps maintain  the integrity of our systems and shields us from potential  risks.  Through meticulous implementation and ongoing surveil- lance, we intend to minimize these risks and amplify the  benefits of AI.  Data privacy Management approach Protection of personal data in the era of digitalization Siemens believes that protecting the personal data of our  stakeholders is our ethical responsibility. As digitalization  and new technologies like artificial intelligence advance,  data protection becomes increasingly important for our  stakeholders and for Siemens\u2019 success. That is why processing  personal data in compliance with applicable data protection  laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR), is of utmost importance to Siemens.  Our data privacy governance and policies Siemens has established a global Data Privacy organization  that follows Siemens\u2019 business structure with data privacy  responsibility residing with each business unit and country.  Overall responsibility lies with the Chief Data Privacy Officer  who reports directly to the CEO of Siemens AG, on an annual  and ad hoc basis. The Chief Data Privacy Officer also issues  the internal Siemens Data Privacy Policies. Our Corporate  data privacy team manages and oversees regulations,   policies, and standards for data privacy in conjunction with  Data Privacy Managers in the business units and countries. Our internal Compliance Policy requires every Siemens  employee to collect and process personal data confidentially,  only for legitimate and predetermined purposes, and in a  transparent manner. This requirement is also reflected in our  BCGs, which contain a section on data privacy requiring  every employee to comply with the data protection require- ments of the laws and regulations within the legal systems  where they are operating, as well as with Siemens\u2019 policies.  In addition, the Siemens Compliance Handbook contains  requirements for processing personal data, for documentation,  and for reporting incidents. Transfers of personal data within the Group are covered by  binding internal data protection regulations: the Siemens  Binding Corporate Rules on Data Protection (BCR). With the  BCR, Siemens Group companies around the world have an  obligation to process personal data from data subjects in the  European Union in accordance with European data protection  standards, even when the recipient of the personal data is  located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Targets Our DEGREE sustainability framework prioritizes the careful  handling of data under \u201cE\u201d for Ethics. Our overarching goal is  a zero-tolerance approach to breaches of applicable laws and  our own internal guidelines. We are proactively working  toward achieving this goal by implementing our data privacy  management system. 3.4 Cybersecurity and data privacy"}, {"knowledge": "Actions and results Siemens\u2019 data privacy management system To put our data privacy measures into action throughout the  Group, Siemens has made them an integral part of our com- pliance system. Our data privacy management system was  established to ensure that all our business activities comply  with data privacy requirements and the applicable laws. The  system specifies policies, procedures, and controls required  by the GDPR, including data subject rights, a privacy incident  process, mandatory trainings, audits, and keeping a record  of processing activities. Transparency and rights of data subjects Our websites, digital products, and solutions include data  privacy policy statements that inform users about processing  steps and data subject rights. When we process personal  data on behalf of customers, we do so under contractual  regulations that govern how the data is handled, including  the transfer of customer data to third parties.  We want our people to be committed to data   protection and regular training  Siemens\u2019 employees receive regular training on how to  handle personal data that is tailored to specific functions  and target groups. For this purpose, we developed a web- based data protection training program consisting of an  \u201cEssentials\u201d level that is mandatory for all employees who  process personal data as part of their job and specialized  \u201cNuggets\u201d designed for specific fields and target groups. Assessing and fostering our privacy by design processes was  a key focus area in fiscal 2023. Privacy by design at Siemens  is supported by our Privacy by Design Toolkit, a software  solution that helps process owners incorporate data privacy  in all the stages of product development. One of the Toolkit  modules includes data privacy questions that must be  answered before the launch of a planned product or service.  The toolkit is intended to integrate data privacy from the  very beginning of a product\u2019s development. We also rolled  out a new privacy by design awareness training program for  product developers in a virtual classroom, learn about and  discuss data privacy challenges drawn from real business  examples. As part of our global audit plan, selected Siemens  products were also included in our data privacy audits.  Data protection at our suppliers and partners Data protection requirements are consistently observed and  implemented within the Group and by our external suppliers  and partners. Suppliers and partners undergo a preliminary  data protection audit and are required by contract to adhere  to data protection standards. Documentation Siemens documents the purpose, risk, and security standards  applied to all the Group\u2019s processing activities in a central  database: the Register of Processing Activities. This register  allows us to evaluate whether data protection law permits a  given processing activity and to document compliance with  the applicable laws. Controls All data protection requirements and measures at Siemens  are subject to regular controls. Siemens conducts risk-based  data protection audits of its processing activities, products,  and services. Treatment of data protection violations In the event of a potential data protection violation, a rapid  response is essential to ensuring that the violation is swiftly  stopped and corrected. To facilitate this, Siemens has estab- lished a global Data Privacy Incident Process that uses central  reporting channels and aims to immediately inform all  internal and external stakeholders (including the data   subjects and regulatory authorities). Data privacy management system   to ensure compliance with data protection  requirements in all business processes Data protection in our products and solutions   (privacy by design) Siemens wants to ensure that its products and solutions can be  used in compliance with all relevant data protection rules. At  Siemens, privacy by design means that compliance with the  law, transparency, informational self-determination, data  minimization, and data security are already applied when  products and services are developed. Therefore,  privacy by  design is integrated into our product development processes.  3.4 Cybersecurity and data privacy"}, {"knowledge": "Pages 54 \u2013 80  Environment  Conservation of nature and resources Decarbonization support the 1.5\u00b0C target to fight global warming Our key ambitions1 \u2192 Net Zero operations by 2030, with 55% reduction  by 2025 and 90% by 2030 \u2192 Net Zero supply chain by 2050, 20% emissions  reduction by 2030  Additional highlights \u2192 Part of the EP100, EV100, and RE100 initiative2  \u2192 Portfolio to support customers in climate protection  \u2192 Disclosure of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-  aligned revenues, capital expenditures, and operating  expenditures Resource efficiency achieve circularity and dematerialization Our key ambitions1 \u2192 Robust Eco Design approach to be implemented for  100% of relevant Siemens product families by 2030 \u2192 Natural resource decoupling through increased  purchase of secondary materials for metals and  resins \u2192 Circularity through waste-to-landfill reduction of  50% by 2025 and toward zero landfill waste by  2030  Additional highlights  \u2192 Assessment of our biodiversity footprint as founda- tion for further improvements  \u2192 Improvements to energy efficiency as part of our  Eco Efficiency @ Siemens target \u2192 Implementation of water strategy almost completed 1 Siemens without SHS.2 Improving energy productivity (EP), use of electric vehicles (EV), and use of renewable energy (RE)."}, {"knowledge": "Management approach Siemens is a global company with locations all over the  world and activities across a wide range of markets. With our  global reach, we aim to minimize our negative impacts and  maximize our positive impacts on the environment: from the  production of raw materials for our products and in our  supply chain and our own production operations to the use,  recycling, and disposal of those products. The significance of environmental protection is continuously  increasing. In a rapidly growing global economy characterized  by ongoing urbanization and rising population numbers,  Siemens supports a number of global green transformation  initiatives. These initiatives include the European Green  Deal, which aims to transition to a circular economy, restore  biodiversity, reduce pollutant emissions into the environ- ment, reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%  below 1990 levels by 2030, and achieve climate neutrality by  2050.  As part of the New Circular Economy Action Plan, the European  Commission proposed the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products  Regulation (ESPR) in March 2022. This regulation aims to  address products\u2019 most harmful environmental impacts and  to transition society from a linear approach to a circular  approach to conducting business. Our governance and policies on environmental protection The Siemens\u2019 Chief People and Sustainability Officer, a mem- ber of the Managing Board, works to ensure that we operate  in compliance with our environmental guidelines. Our EHS  Principles serve as internal binding guidelines for this purpose. Holistic environmental protection Our internal sustainability network includes environmental  officers at our sites and specialists in product-related envi- ronmental protection. The Environmental Protection depart- ment is developing programs to support Siemens\u2019 businesses  in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  in our operations and promote resource efficiency. The   Sustainability department is responsible for the consolidated  Siemens GHG reporting and our Net Zero Operations Program. With the support of our EHS experts and sustainability officers,  the operational managers in our global units oversee the  implementation of environmental guidelines and programs.  Siemens has also founded expert panels to ensure that  environmental considerations are integral to our decision-  making. The Global Board EHS is comprised of subject-matter  experts who develop environmental protection measures  and programs and provide advice to the Chief People and  Sustainability Officer in consultation with the Siemens   Sustainability Board. Siemens\u2019 Environmental Council assesses Siemens\u2019 environ- mental risks, opportunities, and trends based on uniform  criteria and reports them to the Siemens Enterprise Risk  Management.

Holistic environmental protection"}, {"knowledge": "Siemens governs all relevant ecological considerations  through our Environmental Protection Standards. These  policies enable us to oversee and improve environmental  management at our sites and to involve our suppliers, service  providers, and contracting partners through the Siemens  Group Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Third-Party Inter- mediaries. With these policies and activities, we extend  environmental protection beyond our own business opera- tions. Our environmental policies also include a commitment  to increasingly mitigate the environmental impact of our  products, systems, solutions, and services. Evaluating sustainability aspects is integral to our due diligence  guidance. This means considering environmental protection  in decisions about corporate mergers and acquisitions.  Our environmental policies require our sites to avoid activities  that have negative impacts on local biodiversity, conduct  water risk analyses, and implement water protection mea- sures. These factors are particularly important in vulnerable  areas. The policies also include mandatory regulations for  handling and reducing CO2e emissions and waste, especially  landfill waste. Lastly, we drive environmental awareness with our Business  Conduct Guidelines and Supplier Code of Conduct, which  include environmental protection requirements.  Targets We strive to go beyond legal requirements by managing the  environmental impact of our business activities throughout  the value chain. We are also aiming to increase our align- ment with economic, ecological, and social requirements.  This helps us to increase our customers\u2019 competitiveness,  while simultaneously supporting the environmental compat- ibility of our business. In collaboration with our business  partners, we plan to steadily reduce the environmental  impact of our products, systems, solutions, and services. We  do this by creating options for repair, reuse, recycling, and  refurbishment and by minimizing our own use or consumption  of energy, materials, and supplies \u2013 while also minimizing  emissions. Siemens\u2019 environmental objectives and ambitions are  embedded in our Eco Efficiency @ Siemens environmental  program, the DEGREE sustainability framework, and other  environmental initiatives. The respective targets are detailed  in the Environmental chapters that follow. Actions and results Environmental management standards and systems Our environmental management is based on the ISO 14001  and 50001 standards for energy-intensive business units and  on the IEC 62430 norm for the environmentally compatible  design of products, systems, solutions, and services. Our own mandatory standard aims to ensure the implemen- tation of these norms, stating that all Siemens\u2019 sites are  required to have an environmental management system in  accordance with ISO 14001. Sites must also operate in com- pliance with existing local environmental regulations and  our internal environmental guidelines. Internal environmen- tal audits are conducted at least once per year to assess and  monitor environmental protection at our sites. As a result, all of our sites have an environmental manage- ment system in place. At least 182 of them, of which 180  have been audited by external auditors, have environmental  management systems that are certified according to the  ISO 14001 standard. This certification requires, among other  things, that all employees whose work has an impact on the  environment at these sites be trained in personnel- and  location-specific environmental protection topics.  Training on environmental protection We are continuously working to increase and improve the  knowledge and awareness of our employees of environmental  protection. To this end, Siemens has implemented mandatory  awareness trainings on environmental topics for all employees  as it is covered in the Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines. Our information campaigns on World Environment Day and  Earth Overshoot Day aim to raise awareness of environmen- tal protection in a global context. As part of the \u201cThank You\u201d  campaign, we recognize employees who have made excep- tional contributions to environmental conservation, and we  share their portraits and success stories on our Siemens  World internal information platform.

Decarbonization targets for our own operations Our Net Zero 2030 pledge We have expanded our ambitions beyond the scope of our  validated Science-Based Target and shortened our timeline  for decarbonization: As part of our DEGREE sustainability  framework (without Siemens Healthineers), we set a goal for  all Siemens production facilities and buildings worldwide  and our vehicle fleet to achieve a Net Zero1 carbon footprint  by 2030. In effect, this means reducing CO2e Scope 1 and 2  emissions in Siemens\u2019 business operations for Siemens without  Siemens Healthineers (SHS) by 90% by 2030, compared to  2019. To achieve this target, Siemens has pledged to invest  an additional \u20ac650 million in its own decarbonization efforts  by 2030. Any residual emissions will then be balanced with  high-quality carbon offsets that meet established standards.

The actions we take within our business processes along  with focused actions in our supply chain and expanded value  chain are key to achieving our targets.  Using renewable energy Even before Siemens joined the RE100 initiative, we worked  continuously to increase the share of electricity we obtain  from renewable sources. Our goal is to use 100% renewable  electricity by 2030. In fiscal 2023, more than 79% of the  electricity we purchased consisted of electricity from renew- able sources. As a result, we reduced emissions by a total of  454 thousand metric tons of CO2e per year compared to the  average electricity mix. A complete conversion to renewable  electricity is not possible yet due to regulatory restrictions in  some countries. Through our membership in RE100, we are  working toward the amendment of these regulations to  make complete conversion a reality. In purchasing renewable  4.1 Climate action"}, {"knowledge": "electricity, we follow the purchasing guidelines of the WWF\u2019s  Next Generation Green Electricity initiative. Siemens has also entered power purchasing agreements  (PPA) to support our supply with renewable electricity. For  instance, in Kalwa, India, we joined a joint venture that  produces renewable electricity using photovoltaic systems.  Another PPA with Enovos Energie Deutschland in Germany\u2019s  South Eifel region will consist of a total of 11 photovoltaic  systems (currently under construction) with a total capacity  of about 200 GWh a year. S\u00fcdeifel GmbH & Co KG is respon- sible for the planning, construction, and operation of the  systems and for marketing the renewable electricity. Siemens  will purchase 39.1 GWh of electricity per year beginning in  January of 2024. The use of biogas is another component of our decarboni- zation strategy. This has reduced our annual emissions by  13 thousand metric tons of CO2e compared to the use of  conventional natural gas. In the U.S. we\u2019ve conducted pilot purchases of over 3.6 mil- lion liters of sustainable aviation fuel.  Reducing motor fleet emissions We are working to reduce the emissions from our motor  vehicle fleet, which comprises around 44,000 vehicles, and  are striving to electrify it completely by 2030 as part of our  EV100 commitment. In fiscal 2023, these emissions totaled  about 210 thousand metric tons of CO2e. We increased the number of electric vehicles to around  4,100 and charging points to around 2,750 in fiscal 2023.  In the UK, we have already made a lot of progress in creating  an exclusively electric vehicle fleet. As a result, 23% of the  company fleet is now all-electric, and electric vehicles  accounted for 44% of all new car orders at the end of fiscal  2023.  In Germany, our commitment to electrification has seen  progress. Of our fleet, over 1,700 vehicles are battery electric  vehicles (BEVs). In fiscal 2023, BEVs comprised 37% of all our  vehicle orders \u2013 a significant increase from the past aver- ages. Initiatives to accelerate electrification, combined with  the rollout of special-edition electric models, have led to an  additional boost, with BEVs comprising 69% of all new orders  from May to the end of September of 2023. Reducing building emissions Regarding building emissions, we are committed to only  owning and occupying assets that are net zero carbon in  operation by the year 2030 as part of our EP100 pledge. We  plan to achieve this goal through various measures, includ- ing building new CO2-neutral buildings, modernizing existing  buildings, and leasing office space that produces the lowest  possible emissions. Once we have exhausted all possible  measures, we plan to purchase high-quality carbon offsets to  compensate for the remaining emissions. Today 37 of our  locations have no net CO2e emissions during regular operation. We issued a guideline that defines the criteria for the  CO2-neutral operation of new buildings and sets maximum  permissible emissions in the supply chain and in construction  activities. In fiscal 2023, we launched our new SRE3 Green  Lease Guideline to improve the ESG performance of all new  leases. Following the guideline, the renovation and expansion  of our Texas facility is planned to reduce 90% of emissions.  In California, a relocation led to using 58% less space and  reducing CO2e emissions by 68 metric tons. With our New-Normal Working Model, emissions from the  use of our buildings and commuting will be reduced, while  emissions from working from home increase. In total, we  calculated emissions from category 3.7, Employee Commut- ing, at 105 thousand metric tons of CO2e, while emissions  created by working from home amounted to 24 thousand  metric tons of CO2e, largely due to using IT equipment. For  more details, see  WORKING AT SIEMENS. Using an internal CO2e price In the UK and Brazil, we are currently using an internal CO2e  price to manage our decarbonization activities. In the UK, we  raised the price per ton of CO2e in fiscal 2023 to GBP50 from  GBP40 to create a clear pathway to increasing CO2e costs. A  major portion of the proceeds is being used to expand the  charging infrastructure for electric vehicles at our new office  location in Farnborough, UK. In Brazil, a so-called shadow  price of US$240 per ton of CO2e was established to support  energy efficiency in buildings and factories and, for example,  to support electrification of the motor vehicle fleet.  3 Siemens Real Estate. 4.1 Climate action"}, {"knowledge": "Upstream emissions Our upstream emissions total roughly 11 million metric tons  of CO2e and are therefore considerably higher than the  emissions from our own business operations.

Emissions produced in the use phase of our products will  continuously decrease over time due to new product gener- ations and to the ongoing transition to renewable energies  in our users\u2019 markets. The use of our products sold in fiscal 2023 will generate  469 million metric tons of CO2e over the entire expected  product use phase (Scope 3.11 Use of sold products). We are  using a constant emission factor over the anticipated prod- uct use phase. Our scope 3 emissions increased due to an  expansion of the reported portfolio as well as increased sales  volumes. We use the final product calculation method. If we  applied the intermediate approach instead, emissions from  the use of our products sold in fiscal 2023 would be consid- erably lower. These emissions are primarily created by the  electricity used and the product\u2019s lifespan. Our Blue GIS portfolio is a prime example of our efforts to  reduce emissions. The portfolio combines the advantages of  gas-insulated switchgear with climate-friendly technologies.  Using a fluorine-gas-free, non-toxic insulating gas reduces  the CO2e emissions of medium-voltage switchgear through- out their entire lifespan. Our contribution to climate protection for our customers (customer avoided emissions) To make our portfolio\u2019s contribution to decarbonization  more transparent, we report the amount of CO2e emissions  that our products and solutions avoid compared to reference  solutions. Customer avoided emissions represent the differ- ence between the CO2e emissions of a Siemens offering and  the CO2e emissions of a baseline or reference scenario.

Software, electrification, and automation technology and  other \u201cenabling technologies\u201d play a crucial role in achieving  global environmental goals by providing systems that sup- port the transition to a low-carbon economy. For example,  solutions from Smart Infrastructure can facilitate the trans- formation to an electrification of the global energy system.  Even though they do not show a direct decarbonization  impact on the product level, the electrification and automa- tion products sold by Smart Infrastructure in fiscal 2023  contributed to the decarbonization of power generation  systems by avoiding 4.6 million metric tons of CO2e emis- sions. The description of our methodology for calculating  these \u201cenabling\u201d customer avoided emissions can be found  in our  REPORTING PRINCIPLES FOR CUSTOMER AVOIDED EMISSIONS.  However, because there is no recognized market standard  for a calculation methodology to quantify these enabling or  indirect decarbonization impacts, we refrain from including  the avoided emissions from enabling technologies in our  overall customer avoided emissions total of 190 million  metric tons of CO2e emissions. Investment-related emissions The financing solutions provided by Siemens Financial Ser- vices (SFS) fund infrastructure projects and technologies  that make a contribution to decarbonization. Specifically,  SFS provides equity and debt financing solutions to support  projects with a total installed capacity of 27,500 MW of wind  energy, 14,900 MW of solar energy, and 2,400 MW of other  renewable energy production technologies (including battery  storage) worldwide. In fiscal 2023, SFS Equity Finance also  invested in carbon removal companies to support innovative  solutions and technologies that actively remove CO2e from  the atmosphere. Where SFS agreed to finance fossil power generation projects  in fiscal 2023, its financial contributions corresponded to  about 3 million metric tons of CO2e over the expected   duration of the financing of these projects (Scope 3.15  investments). Carbon offsets Our internal offsetting policy has established binding guide- lines for procuring carbon offsets. This policy aims to ensure  consistency and quality in offset programs. The carbon off- sets derived from projects for removing or avoiding CO2e  emissions must meet minimum quality criteria, including  external certification, selection based on the Oxford Offset- ting Principles, and internal quality controls. Despite our  high standard for all offsetting, physically reducing emissions  remains Siemens\u2019 top priority. We also do not deduct carbon  offsets from our CO2e footprint in order to maintain transpar- ency regarding our emissions.  Shaping the climate debate and policy  Siemens is part of a number of platforms and initiatives that  allow us to participate in the debate on climate-related issues.  For example, as part of the UN Global Compact Peer-Learning  Group, we are sharing knowledge and lessons learned on  various climate-related topics with other companies. 4.1 Climate action"}, {"knowledge": "Beyond our various measures and activities, Siemens also  participates in committees and associations where it advo- cates for more changes in climate policy frameworks in order  to support the following activities: \u2192 Accelerating decarbonization in all sectors through efficient  energy use and electrification and by increasing the share  of energy from renewable sources \u2192 Redesigning energy markets to ensure that adequate  investments are made in sustainable, secure, and efficient  energy systems \u2192 Driving the development of local energy production from  renewable sources, local energy markets, and sector  coupling \u2192 Accelerating the digitalization of the energy system to  enable the integration of renewable energies, continuous  grid optimization, and the integration of prosumers, while  guaranteeing grid stability \u2192 Implementing a CO2e price that enables actual emissions-  related costs to be integrated into business decision-  making.

Energy is an important resource in production, and its usage  reduction is a key strategy for decarbonization. While we aim  to obtain all our electricity from renewable sources, we   recognize that even the generation of renewable electricity,  for example, through wind turbines or photovoltaics, can  have negative impacts on the environment because these  systems must be manufactured, they change the local   landscape when in operation, and they must be disposed of  at the end of their lifecycle.  The emission of air pollutants like volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) can  lead to ground-level ozone and have adverse health effects,  and some are potent greenhouse gases.  While many types of waste can be recycled or reprocessed in  a functioning circular economy, the production of landfill  waste contributes to land use and greenhouse gas emissions,  and it influences local biodiversity and can cause health  problems for people and ecosystems. By fostering recycling,  Siemens can also reduce potential impacts in the down- stream value chain like marine plastics pollution and in the  upstream value chain from sourcing primary raw materials. Water use in water-stressed areas can exacerbate water  scarcity, degrade water quality, and harm aquatic habitats  and biodiversity.  Lastly, biodiversity loss is comparable to the threat of climate  change, because it can disrupt the functioning of ecosystems,  creating far-reaching impacts on people\u2019s health and liveli- hoods. Our governance and policies for conserving resources To mitigate these impacts, we made the responsible use of  limited resources an integral part of environmental protection  at Siemens. Information on our holistic environmental pro- tection governance and policies can be found in  HOLISTIC  Targets Our commitment to conserving resources is also reflected in  the field of action Resource efficiency in our DEGREE sustain- ability framework.  The component Efficient Own Operations of our Eco Effi- ciency @ Siemens program aims to reduce the environmental  impact of our sites through dematerialization and circular  economy principles. We focus on improving our energy effi- ciency and reducing the environmental impact of the waste  we generate. When it comes to environmentally responsible  energy use, we focus on reducing emissions from power  generation in addition to minimizing energy consumption  itself. As part of our commitment, we aim to improve our  overall energy efficiency by 10% by 2030 compared to 2021.1  Building on the success of previous reduction initiatives, our  target is to achieve a 50% reduction in landfill waste by 2025  compared to fiscal 2021 as we progress toward zero landfill  waste by 2030. Additionally, we want to continuously  increase our material recycling rate by 2030.1  1 Siemens without SHS. 4.2 Conserving resources"}, {"knowledge": "In addition to our Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program, we  actively pursue resource conservation through other initia- tives. We have implemented initiatives to manage our envi- ronmental impact in areas like water, air pollutants, and  biodiversity.

With  continuing gas shortages, this was a special focus for  Siemens in fiscal 2023. To determine energy consumption by  our company vehicles, we calculated the consumption of all  cars used by employees and for services and our trucks. In  fiscal 2023, the company fleet consumed about 2,894 thou- sand gigajoules of fuel, which is a 1% decrease from the  previous fiscal year.  Secondary energy consumption means the purchase of  electricity and district heating at our sites worldwide.

This figure includes nitrogen oxides that are released  by burning the fuels listed under primary energy. 4.2 Conserving resources"}, {"knowledge": "Efficient waste management The environmental relevance of waste depends on the type  of waste and the method used for its disposal. To reduce  hazardous waste, we work on increasing our material recy- cling rate and reducing our landfill waste. To enhance  material efficiency in our production processes, we imple- ment practices like regrinding sprue parts at plastic molding  sites.  To support resource efficiency in production, our sites track  waste data using a standard process that undergoes regular  audits that aim to ensure accuracy and compliance. In addi- tion, we distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous  waste. The treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous  waste is further subdivided into material recycling, thermal  recovery, thermal disposal, and landfill. Waste flows from  construction or demolition work are reported separately,  because these waste categories are created independent of  production. We then go beyond the monitoring of our own  activities to analyze the waste generated throughout our  upstream supply chain.  The volume of non-hazardous waste generated by Siemens\u2019  own operations declined by 4% compared to the previous  fiscal year, whereas the volume of hazardous waste  decreased in the same period by 8%. Construction waste  increased by 88% in fiscal 2023, mainly driven by the con- struction site at our Campus in Erlangen. Compared to fiscal  2022, the total waste volume increased by 2% in fiscal 2023.  Water use and risk analysis Water is one of humanity\u2019s most important resources. For  this reason, Siemens has been analyzing water scarcity,  water pollution, local fire risks, climate change, and flooding  and precipitation patterns at our sites for several years. We  consider these analyses in our business decisions: for exam- ple, when we select the location for a new site or implement  precautionary measures. We establish water targets at multiple sites to account for the  specific local environment and to drive effective mitigation  measures. At the corporate level, we have implemented a  defined water strategy, and have conducted risk assessments  to shape local water targets.  Our individual sites then implement their own water initia- tives in alignment with these targets. For instance, by  greening the roofs of our Siemens Campus in Erlangen, we  return rainwater back into the natural water cycle through  evaporation, rather than disposing of it in the sewer system.  The aim of our water strategy is to minimize the adverse  local effects of our water consumption and use. In fiscal  2022, we expanded the analysis of our water-related risks to  include our supply chain. Based on this analysis, we derived  further measures for sustainable water use.

Biodiversity  and conservation are defined in our environmental policies  as environmental aspects at the company level that need to  be assessed locally. The objective is to ensure that the business  activities at our factories and offices do not reduce species  diversity beyond an unavoidable minimum. This approach is  part of our location planning, which also includes initiatives  to foster biodiversity by creating habitats that provide both  shelter and food. Examples range from planting native vegeta- tion, creating homes for insects, birds, mammals, reptiles,  and amphibians to taking inventories of the local biodiversity  at our sites. Two locations in Germany are using sheep as  \u201clawn-mowers\u201d to reduce our impact on flora and fauna by  maintaining green spaces. Siemens employees are actively  engaged in protecting and increasing biodiversity at their  locations: for example, by volunteering for tree-planting  campaigns and participating in cleanup events. For our Siemens Campus in Erlangen, we have developed a  comprehensive biodiversity concept that enables us to   preserve existing trees, plant native fruit trees, and create  suitable nesting habitats for many species, among other  initiatives. To further develop our approach to biodiversity, we have  entered a strategic partnership with The Biodiversity Consul- tancy to help Siemens scientifically assess our biodiversity  footprint. This assessment was conducted in fiscal 2023 and  covered the biodiversity impacts of our own operations and  those of our upstream value chain: for instance, impacts of  the raw materials we purchase. The assessment and the  transparency we acquired on our biodiversity footprint are  an important step toward developing our biodiversity strategy. appliances, installing rainwater harvesting systems at four  major factory locations, and building water reclamation  facilities (zero liquid discharge facilities). These measures  enable us to reduce fresh water consumption by, among  other things, utilizing treated water for landscaping and  toilet flushing. Our water risk analysis begins with an assessment of our  environmentally relevant sites using the Aqueduct Water  Risk Atlas from the World Resources Institute (WRI). With the  aid of an internal analytical tool, Siemens assesses local-level  risks resulting from our sites\u2019 activities, and then assesses  them in relation to regional water risks. Sites with a high-risk  assessment need to define targets to reduce the level of risk.

In fiscal 2023, our total water withdrawal was 14.26 million m\u00b3. The largest share of our water use is for cooling processes.  These processes leave the water\u2019s chemical quality largely  unchanged, so that the water can be returned directly to the  receiving water body or groundwater. In fiscal 2023, our  water discharge was 13.56 million m3. Water consumption is a water substream with a major envi- ronmental impact, because the water is no longer available  for the ecosystem\u2019s use. Siemens\u2019 water consumption is  mostly linked to evaporation and is comparably small, with  just 0.51 million m3 of total water consumption. Of this  amount, 0.07 million m3 are accounted for by water con- sumption in water stress areas.

We calculate the revenue share of our RED-con- formant portfolio by multiplying the RED implementation  rate with the revenues of the given product families. Lastly,  the implementation rate KPI for RED is calculated as the ratio  of the total RED-conformant revenue share to the total reve- nues of the relevant product families. The RED approach allows us to use good practice results to  identify practical Ecodesign measures in a product family  that can then be used in other product families. Scheduled  community meetings of product-related environmental   protection practitioners facilitate this good practice   knowledge-sharing across our business units. We also host  Ecodesign case studies on an internal wiki to facilitate  knowledge-sharing between our business units.  Focus in fiscal 2023 As a critical precondition for implementing our RED  approach, we worked on developing automated solutions to  calculate LCAs and generate EPDs in fiscal 2023. This aims to  facilitate Ecodesign comparisons and the systematic use of  LCAs and EPDs at Siemens. We also published an  INTERNAL  ON ECODESIGN to ensure alignment, increase transparency, and  accelerate knowledge generation on Ecodesign. e f u r b i s h m e n t   a n d r e m a n u f a c t u r i n g e p a ir   a n d  r e us e e cy cl in g Waste recoveryRaw material  extraction Ecodesign Production Manufacturing Use Siemens\u2019 vision of an almost completely closed lifecycle when applying our RED approach 4.3 Product stewardship"}, {"knowledge": "Clean Supply Chain: Using secondary materials to decouple natural resource use  Building on the RED phase dematerialization, the Clean  Supply Chain category in the Eco Efficiency @ Siemens   program maps our path to decoupling natural resource use  from our economic growth.  In fiscal 2023, we emphasized making a continuous material  change from plastics made from fossil fuels to sustainable  and secondary thermoplastics. For example, we introduced  a sustainable polyamide 6 composite with a recycling con- tent of 25% to 75% that engineers can apply in their designs.  This can lead to a reduction of the product carbon footprint  of 10% to 35%, depending on the application. We also devel- oped an internal standard for sustainable plastics and using  of biobased resins made from waste. Risk-aware handling of declarable substances  Another essential aspect of product stewardship is the  responsible handling of substances that are potentially haz- ardous for the environment or health, like those regulated by  the EU REACH regulation. We modify internal IT procedures  and material compliance processes with the aim of making  the use of these substances safer. We are also working pro- actively to substitute and reduce them wherever we can. We  work to continuously increase the utilization of the digital  industrial substance database BOMcheck by our suppliers.  We comply fully with the declaration requirements of inter- national legislation and IEC 62474, and we are constantly  optimizing our interfaces and automated workflows. Currently, up to 50% of our revenue (Siemens without SHS)  comes from products, systems, solutions, and services that  contain substances or groups of substances regulated by  IEC 62474. We are continuously seeking ways to replace  these substances whenever technically possible and reason- able. By systematically applying our approaches to environmen- tally compatible product, system, solution, and service  design and closely collaborating with our business partners,  we intend to comprehensively support the replacement of  declarable substances and decouple economic development  from resource consumption. Training and stakeholder involvement in product stewardship We actively involve our customers in our Ecodesign  approaches. Our business units reach out to customers to  discover their specific requirements for Ecodesign measures  and to get feedback on measures already implemented.  Regular workshops with selected customers like wholesalers  are conducted to poll their opinions on required or  performed  Ecodesign measures.  Since fiscal 2022, the two-part Circular Design learning pro- gram has been available online to all Siemens employees.  In addition, we developed the Leading in Sustainability as  part of the Top Management Leadership Program, a learning  program for our leaders with also a focus on the circular  economy. We maintain internal stakeholder engagement and  raise awareness with measures like environmental protection  newsletters and environmental information campaigns.  4.3 Product stewardship"}, {"knowledge": "4.4EU Taxonomy The information for Siemens\u2019 EU Taxonomy reporting accord- ing to article 8 of the EU regulation (EU) 2020/852 and  associated delegated acts is disclosed in its Combined Man- agement Report \u2013 the following chapter provides further  information.  The EU Taxonomy regulation was introduced to propose a  framework to facilitate sustainable investment as part of  EU\u2019s efforts to implement the European Green Deal. It is a  key element of the European Commission\u2019s action plan to  achieve the EU\u2019s ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2050  by redirecting capital flows towards sustainable activities  and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy. The Taxonomy is a classification system which aims to identify  if a company\u2019s activities are considered as environmentally  sustainable. Siemens supports the EU agenda\u2019s general objectives of  carbon neutrality by 2050 and the direction of capital flows  towards sustainable activities. Siemens also supports the EU  Taxonomy by improving transparency helping scale up   sustainable investment and achieving the Union\u2019s decarbon- ization and environmental objectives. EU Taxonomy at a glance The EU Taxonomy\u2019s classification system defines economic  activities as environmentally sustainable based on their rele- vance to one of the following six environmental objectives  and their fulfilment of predetermined criteria: I. Climate change mitigation II. Climate change adaptation III. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine  resources IV. Transition to a circular economy V. Pollution prevention and control VI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems For each environmental objective, a catalog of relevant  economic activities has been defined. When a business  activity meets the definition of an economic activity, it is  referred to as Taxonomy-eligible. EU Taxonomy alignment  then requires the fulfillment of both the criteria for Substan- tial Contribution (SC) and the criteria for Do No Significant  Harm (DNSH), together called Technical Screening Criteria  (TSC). Moreover, the company involved must observe Mini- mum Safeguards (MS), e.g., compliance with human rights  principles. The EU Taxonomy\u2019s catalog of economic activities includes  business activities with the most potential for contributing to  the six defined environmental objectives. If a business activ- ity does not fall within the scope of the EU Taxonomy, it does  not give an indication that such businesses could not be  sustainable. For the reporting year 2023, EU Taxonomy  reporting is limited to the first two environmental objectives  (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation). With expansion of the criteria on all six environmental objec- tives for fiscal 2024, we expect an increased EU Taxonomy  coverage for our portfolio in the next year. EU Taxonomy in the context of our Industrial Business Siemens\u2019 Industrial Business, which includes Digital Indus- tries, Smart Infrastructure, Siemens Mobility, and Siemens  Healthineers, is developing a wide range of solutions for a  path to a sustainable future. Digital Industries (DI) offers a comprehensive portfolio of  products, services and solutions for automation and soft- ware for the discrete and process industries. It enables   customers to optimize their entire value chain from product  design, development, and production facility modeling to  production operation and after-sales service. The Digital  Industry portfolio enhances efficiency, conserves resources,  and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  4.4 EU taxonomy"}, {"knowledge": "The EU Taxonomy\u2019s current eligibility rules for reporting on  climate change mitigation and adaption cover the Digital  Industries portfolio to a limited extent only. With the appli- cation of the four new environmental objectives for fiscal  2024 and amendments to existing objectives, an increased  coverage of business activities is expected. The Smart Infrastructure (SI) portfolio includes a wide range  of products, services, solutions, and software for all aspects  of grid management, electrical products, building automation,  fire protection and security, e-mobility charging infrastructure,  and energy efficiency. It offers smart connections for energy  systems, buildings, and industries. An important portion of this portfolio is devoted to integrating  renewable energy into the power grid, increasing electromo- bility, enhancing energy efficiency in buildings, and making  the measurement of infrastructure more transparent using  digital tools and data management solutions. Smart Infra- structure contributes to electrification with a broad portfolio  of low- and medium-voltage power distribution and electrical  installation equipment. The Smart Infrastructure portfolio  supports driving decarbonization, resource efficiency, and  the people-centricity of energy systems, buildings, and  industries by connecting the real and digital worlds. A material portion of the Smart Infrastructure portfolio is  eligible for climate objective-related EU Taxonomy reporting,  especially energy-efficient equipment for buildings and ser- vices for energy performance of buildings. With the addition  of more activities for climate change mitigation and for the  other environmental objectives, we expect an increased  coverage of our business activities for fiscal 2024. Siemens Mobility (SMO) combines all Siemens businesses in  the area of rail passenger and freight transportation. The  portfolio includes products and solutions related to rolling  stock (like trains and locomotives), rail infrastructure (includ- ing rail automation and electrification), and the service  business, e.g., maintenance and digital services. Its offerings  comprise software solutions, like train planning systems,  Mobility-as-a-Service (Maas), reservation management and  ticketing, and a turnkey business that bundles consulting,  planning, financing, constructing, servicing, and operating  of complete mobility systems. Siemens Mobility enables transportation operators around  the world to make their trains and infrastructure smart and  electrified, and contributes to efficient, low-carbon transpor- tation. Leveraging the advantages of digitalization, it helps  increase sustainable value creation throughout the entire  lifecycle, improve passenger comfort, deliver 100% system  availability, and maximize network capacity. The Siemens Mobility portfolio is almost fully eligible,   contributing to climate change mitigation through manufac- turing of low-carbon technologies for transportation, and  providing infrastructure for rail transportation and infra- structure enabling public transport. Siemens Healthineers (SHS) is a global provider of healthcare  products, solutions, and services with holistic system com- petence. The portfolio serves clinical decision-making and  treatment pathways definition \u2013 from in vitro and in vivo  diagnostics to image-guided therapy and innovative cancer  treatment. The comprehensive portfolio supports customers  along the entire care continuum, from prevention and early  detection through to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up  care. Siemens Healthineers concluded in its analysis of contributing  activities, that the current climate-related objectives are not  applicable to manufacturing of medical products, which is  Siemens Healthineers\u2019 primary activity. Taxonomy-relevant  capital expenditures are for the most part reported under  selected economic activities referring to construction and  real estate. With the release of the four new environmental  objectives, Siemens Healthineers expects an increased   coverage of its economic activities. Eligibility assessment at Siemens The purpose of the eligibility assessment is to determine if  Siemens\u2019 business activities fit the description of one of the  economic activities specified by the EU Taxonomy. If a  Siemens business activity matches, it is then classified as  \u201celigible\u201d. A business activity that is \u201cnon-eligible\u201d is not  within the scope of the EU Taxonomy reporting. The eligibility  assessments were conducted decentrally in the businesses in  an interdisciplinary manner involving experts, for instance  from technical, strategy, or sustainability departments. 4.4 EU taxonomy"}, {"knowledge": "For fiscal 2023, Siemens\u2019 Industrial Business reported its  Taxonomy-eligible revenue shares under the following EU  Taxonomy activities of climate change mitigation: Economic ActivityIndustrial Business 3.1 Manufacture of renewable energy technologiesSI 3.3  Manufacture of low carbon technologies for  transportSMO 3.5  Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildingsSI 3.6 Manufacture of other low-carbon technologiesDI, SI 4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricitySI 6.14 Infrastructure for rail transportSMO 6.15  Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transportSMO, SI 6.16 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon water transportSI 7.3  Installation, maintenance and repair of energy   efficiency equipmentSI 7.4  Installation, maintenance and repair of charging   stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and  parking spaces attached to buildings)SI 7.5  Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildingsSI 7.6  Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologiesSI 8.2  Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductionsDI, SI 9.3  Professional services related to energy performance of buildingsSI Alignment assessment at Siemens In the next step, Siemens\u2019 Taxonomy-eligible activities were  evaluated against the technical screening criteria for Sub- stantial Contribution (SC) and Do No Significant Harm  (DNSH) according to the Delegated Acts. Siemens also  needed to prove its compliance with Minimum Safeguards:  namely, on human rights and good business conduct rules. Substantial Contribution (SC): Following the eligibility  assessment, the alignment of all eligible business activities  with the SC criteria outlined in the respective Delegated Acts  was assessed. This was conducted and documented at the  highest appropriate reporting hierarchy level, such as business  segment, product family or project level \u2013 depending on the  relevant SC criteria and the respective business activity. Do No Significant Harm (DNSH): Once a business activity  demonstrated a SC, its compliance with the DNSH criteria  was assessed. Based on the specific regulatory requirements  outlined in the Delegated Acts, the assessment was con- ducted by technical experts on the product, site, project and/ or supplier levels.  Minimum Safeguards (MS): An additional requirement for EU  Taxonomy alignment is compliance with MS as outlined in  Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The MS criteria  require business activities to be compliant with the following  regulations: \u2192 OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; \u2192 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,  including the principles and rights set out in the eight  core conventions identified in the International Labor  Organization\u2019s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Rights  and Principles at Work, \u2192 The International Bill of Human Rights. Based on its implemented group-wide structures on risk  analysis, corporate guidelines and due diligence processes  and mechanisms, Siemens is fulfilling the MS requirements.

Based on the eligibility and alignment assess- ments described above, the baseline values for revenue,  capital expenditures (CapEx), and operating expenditures  (OpEx) were analyzed and, if applicable, mapped to the  respective EU Taxonomy activities. Allocations were also  applied based on eligible and/or aligned revenue in order to  link capital expenditures and operating expenditures to the  respective activities. Siemens implemented a supporting IT  tool for the EU Taxonomy technical eligibility and alignment  assessments and associated documentation. To avoid double  counting, the mapping was consistently made to only one  economic activity. Revenue KPI  The revenue KPI shows the ratio of revenue from Taxonomy-  eligible and/or aligned economic activities to the total revenue  in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the reporting  year. Based on an assessment of the Siemens business port- folio, Taxonomy-eligible revenue accounted for 20.3% and  Taxonomy-aligned revenue for 16.5% of total revenue. This  translates into \u20ac15.7 billion in Taxonomy-eligible revenue  and \u20ac12.8 billion in aligned revenue. Taxonomy-eligible and aligned economic activities were  primarily driven by the (i) Manufacture of low-carbon tech- nologies for transport (Climate Change Mitigation, CCM  3.3), (ii) rail transportation infrastructure (CCM 6.14), (iii)  Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public  transport (CCM 6.15), all associated with Mobility busi- nesses, as well as (iv) energy-efficient building technologies  (CCM 3.5) and (v) services for energy-efficient building  technologies (CCM 7.5), both related to Smart Infrastructure  businesses. The difference between Taxonomy-eligible revenue and  Taxonomy-aligned revenue is mainly due to DNSH criteria  related to pollution prevention as part of Appendix C, which  go beyond existing national regulation. This is mainly  because additionally required documentation is not com- pletely available yet.  Capital expenditures KPI The CapEx KPI shows the ratio of CapEx from Taxonomy-  eligible and/or aligned economic activities to the total CapEx,  reflecting additions (including additions from business  combinations) to other intangible assets and property, plant  and equipment in accordance with Note 13 to the Consoli- dated Financial Statements. In the reporting year, 34.5%  (\u20ac1.3 billion) of Siemens\u2019 CapEx were eligible, and 12.2%  (\u20ac0.5 billion) were aligned. The aligned CapEx is composed  as follows: a majority of \u20ac0.4 billion is related to additions to  property, plant and equipment, the remainder pertains to  internally generated intangible assets and capitalized right- of-use assets. This aligned CapEx includes \u20ac116 million related to a CapEx  plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by   fiscal 2028, summing up to a planned total volume of  \u20ac1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs). The  buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon  emissions (CCM 7.7). Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) related to  Siemens\u2019 real estate portfolio represents the largest portion  in overall CapEx eligibility. The difference between Taxonomy-  eligible CapEx and Taxonomy-aligned CapEx is impacted by  (i) only partial availability of information on energy perfor- mance certificates for our global portfolio and (ii) energy  certificates below the required threshold defined in the  Substantial Contribution criteria for the energy efficiency of  buildings. Operating expenditures KPI The OpEx KPI shows the ratio of OpEx from Taxonomy-  eligible and/or aligned economic activities to total OpEx. The  total OpEx comprises direct non-capitalized costs related to  research and development, building renovation measures,  short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, and any other  direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of  assets of property, plant, and equipment per Annex I of the  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. 12.4%  (\u20ac0.9 billion) of Siemens\u2019 OpEx were eligible and 8.2%  (\u20ac0.6 billion) were aligned. 4.4 EU taxonomy"}, {"knowledge": "The majority of eligible and/or aligned expenditures relate to  processes and assets associated with the economic activities  described for the revenue KPI: (i) Manufacture of low-carbon  technologies for transport (CCM 3.3) and (ii) rail transportation  infrastructure (CCM 6.14). These two activities account for  half of eligible OpEx and the majority of aligned OpEx. This aligned OpEx includes \u20ac3 million related to a CapEx  plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by   fiscal 2028, summing up to a planned total volume of  \u20ac1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs). The  buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon  emissions (CCM 7.7).

We offer flexible benefits  programs that support our people\u2019s physical, mental, finan- cial, career, and social well-being throughout their work-life  journey. With equity and inclusion in mind, the Siemens  benefits programs2 aim to empower our people to realize  their full potential and strengthen their resilience through a  variety of benefits programs, insurance policies, retirement  arrangements, and elective coverage. With an eye on sus- tainability as well as the diverse and evolving needs of our  global team and their families, the external market is closely  monitored for the latest industry trends and innovations.  Eligibility for Siemens sponsored benefits such as share  plans, company pension scheme, the employee benefits  programs, and parental/family leave regulations varies by  country. Country-specific plans generally follow local regula- tions and market practices. Work-life balance To provide our people with even more flexibility and individ- ual solutions, we offer flexible working models. These models  are structured according to local requirements and in ways  that are compatible with the employees\u2019 roles. For instance,  Siemens offers mobile working, part-time hours, sabbaticals,  time-outs, parental/family leave, and partial early retirement.  Parental leave for first and second care enables our people to  manage their unique work-life needs. 2 Siemens without SHS. 5.1 Working at Siemens"}, {"knowledge": "There are other options that our people in Germany can  benefit from; for example, approximately 1,3002 childcare  places, a summer vacation childcare program, and parent-  child health retreats. The FutureOfWork@SIEMENS initiative The Siemens #FutureOfWork initiative tackles structural  changes in the working environment by asking two essential  questions:  \u2192 HOW will we work in the future? (#NewWork) \u2192 WHAT will we work on in the future? (#NextWork) #NewWork focuses on helping organizations and individuals  become more flexible and adaptable. For instance, exploring  new forms of agile organization, collaboration, leadership,  and flexible working conditions. In 2020, Siemens introduced #NextWork, which is a method- ology we use to proactively tackle the changing environment  by preparing the organization and our people to stay relevant  and employable. With #NextWork, we\u2019re addressing the key  question of what our future jobs will look like. This includes  identifying the roles, skills, and tasks of tomorrow and pro- viding specific and actionable workforce transformation  roadmaps through our WIN, GROW, and BOND measures.  Engagement with stakeholders To highlight our culture of trust and empowerment, we are  pursuing two initiatives that concentrate on understanding  and taking account of our people\u2019s experiences and recog- nizing their achievements: We use the results of our Siemens Global Engagement   Survey (SGES)2 at regular intervals to assess the efficiency  and success of our actions and to derive any necessary steps  for improvement. In January 2023, we had a response rate  for the SGES of 65% (decrease of 4 percentage points from  the year before). Our People Net Promoter Score (pNPS) was  39 (+3 points from the prior year). Mobile working has been established as a core element of  the \u201cNew Normal\u201d in order to promote a sustainable work  culture and environment. We also encourage our people to achieve a balance between  work and caring for relatives. As this topic continues to grow  in importance, we will support our people in Germany who  provide care for close family members. We offer a variety of  support options through the Elder Care program. This pro- gram is based on four pillars: time off work and flexible  working, communication, counseling, and training on health  matters. Childcare at Siemens In fiscal 2023, as part of its family-friendly corporate policy,  Siemens AG supported its people in Germany with a general  tax-free childcare allowance of up to \u20ac100 per calendar  month per child for the care of preschool-age children at a  day-care center or similar facility. Siemens AG also grants its  part-time employees in Germany a tax-free childcare allow- ance during parental leave for children up to 14 months of age. 2 Siemens without SHS.

Equity is an essential part of our corporate culture.  Inclusion enables every voice to be heard and every individual  to get involved. We believe that focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion  reduces the risk of making biased talent decisions. We have  implemented recruitment and promotion strategies that  promote equity of opportunities through our Gender Equity  Program (GEP)1. We also offer various training opportunities  on our new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Learning  Channel, we empower managers and teams through our  Belonging Playbook, and we foster an open dialog and  insights on diversity, equity, and inclusion for all our people  on our Belonging Days.

We do not tolerate discrimination,  sexual or any other form of harassment, or inappropriate  behavior toward individuals or groups. The guidelines clearly  state: \u2192 \u201cWe respect the personal dignity, privacy, and rights of  each individual. We believe diversity enriches our work- place.

Our German prototype program \u201cTrans* at work\u201d supports  our people with collegial counselling before, during, and  after transition.1 Following its success, we developed rele- vant program guidelines for our people and managers.

At Siemens, we believe that each person is of value  and importance, regardless of their ability. And while we aim  for a barrier-free work environment at Siemens, inclusion  means more than just accessibility. It is a holistic way of  thinking and acting that eliminates both visible and invisible  barriers and encourages a culture of conscious, equitable  participation and understanding. We believe that this way of  thinking supports and enables people with disabilities to be  included and to give their best. The Ability@Siemens1 initiative promotes a culture of inte- gration for approximately 4,8003 disabled people currently  working at Siemens in Germany. It is based on an inclusion  agreement with the general representative board for dis- abled employees.4 Global awareness days foster the spirit of tolerance and acceptance We foster the spirit of tolerance and acceptance at Siemens  worldwide through our internal campaigns on global aware- ness days: for instance, International Women\u2019s Day and  Global Accessibility Awareness Day.

The world of work is changing dynamically, as are the  demands and needs regarding health and safety. A core task  for our occupational health and safety department is to  maintain and further improve the resilience, adaptability,  and well-being of our people. We believe that focusing on  health and safety management reduces the risk of physical  injuries and mental ill health. Siemens aims to mitigate  health and safety risks effectively through management  systems, designing healthy and safe working conditions,  internal monitoring, and controls. Our Employee Assistance  Program also supports our people in coping with psychosocial  personal concerns through individual counseling. Adapting  and re-designing our work systems is a continuous task. The  goal is to empower our people to get involved, engage, and  participate. By changing the way we work, digitalization  provides the opportunity to steadily improve our health and  safety assessments and management systems globally. Our occupational health and safety governance and policies  The Environmental Protection, Health Management, and  Safety (EHS) department manages health and safety mea- sures at Siemens. It is organized locally, integrated into each  business unit and each regional company, and reports  directly to the respective business manager. EHS Officers coordinate the collaboration of EHS experts  across the various fields of action. The main task of this  expert function is to advise managers and teams. The func- tion\u2019s profile has changed significantly in recent years:  Rather than monitoring compliance with rules and workflows  as in the past, the focus is now on supporting our people in  dealing safely with dynamically changing requirements.  Health and safety committees that meet regularly have been  established in the relevant country organizations and on the  local level. Here, management and employee representatives  jointly coordinate the specific measures and initiatives  needed for a healthy and safe work environment.  Based on our Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs), we have  established internal monitoring systems and a company-  wide risk management and control process. We anchor our actions in Siemens\u2019 EHS Principles, which  embed our EHS policy. They also include an obligation for all  operating units to demonstrate a management system certi- fiable to ISO 45001. The effectiveness of these management  systems is subject to an annual internal review that checks,  among other things, whether processes for risk assessments  and emergency management are implemented in accor- dance with internal and external regulations, that inspec- tions and reviews have been carried out, significant risks and  opportunities have been identified and whether they are  reflected in measurable goals and measures. The manage- ment system is also externally certified according to market  requirements in the respective operating units.  Siemens\u2019 suppliers commit to upholding the Siemens Group  Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries  and Business Partners. This Code of Conduct obligates our  suppliers to comply with health and safety standards and to  take responsibility for the health and well-being of their  employees. 5.4 Occupational health and safety management"}, {"knowledge": "Progress on DEGREE ambition #14:  30% improvement in Siemens\u2019 globally aggregated LTIFR by 2025 30% improvement in the global accident rate (LTIFR)  by 2025 (base year: 2020) \u2013 compared to the refer- ence value of 0.31 in fiscal 2020, we have achieved  an improvement of 26% to date.

Safety, health, resilience, and well-being are intangible  assets for our company.  The company-wide Healthy and Safe @ Siemens program1 Our company-wide Healthy and Safe @ Siemens (HS @ S)  program invites employees to help shape leadership, learn  from each other, increase well-being at work, and promote  innovations and improvements in occupational health and  safety. It is based on five principles: In the second step, measures are defined and agreed upon  for resilient health & safety management.  The results are then evaluated in the third step. The principles guide the process of HS @ S in three steps:  reality check, resilient health and safety management, and  evaluation. The reality check helps build a comprehensive understanding  of the status of health and safety. It includes a survey that  provides a snapshot of employee perception across various  aspects in the categories \u201cwork climate,\u201d \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201clearn- ing,\u201d and \u201cprocesses and resources.\u201d Results are reviewed  and potential for improvement is identified. Based on the  first rollout of the HS @ S, additional perspectives \u2013 including  the perceptions of management in key functions and data- based expert views \u2013 were added to the reality check.   Furthermore, in fiscal 2023, the management\u2019s perceptions  of our business challenges and their impacts on health and  safety were added by interviews and specific local factors  influencing health and safety were further analyzed.  We care for our own and each other\u2019s well-being.  We speak up and take part in making the workplace  healthier and safer. We are inclusive and invite a diverse range of views  on health and safety. We are engaged in learning and sharing about how  we can work better, safer, and healthier.  We prepare for and adapt well to changing circum- stances. Siemens has created a toolbox containing the necessary  materials for implementing the HS @ S process that can be  customized to each country, location, and business. The program is designed to run until 2030. Individual priorities  and objectives may be adjusted over time. Two of the key  results (access to Employee Assistance Program and 30%  improvement in the global accident rate (LTIFR)) have also  been incorporated into the DEGREE sustainability framework  in the field of action Employability.1 Continued demand for occupational health and safety management  Addressing the increasing need to enhance both individual  and organizational resilience is crucial in today\u2019s world. This  is essential for the sustainability of our business operations  and also aligns with the sustainability imperative.

In addition, we facilitate a successful return to  work by supporting our employees with reintegration mea- sures and ergonomic advice. 94%1 of our employees were able to take advantage of a  wide range of health education offerings designed to  strengthen their health literacy. These offerings are delivered  through a holistic approach that covers physical, mental, and  social health and well-being.  Accident numbers at a low level In fiscal 2023, the number of work-related accidents further  decreased, which correlated with the reduction in the global  accident rate (LTIFR) for the same period. Accidents are  analyzed and lessons are derived to continuously improve  and minimize the occurrence of accidents. The characteris- tics of this year\u2019s accidents are comparable to the previous  year: 78% of the reported incidents were assigned to the \u201cminor\u201d  category (minor injuries like scratches and abrasions). Finger  injuries continued to account for the majority of incidents. 4 fatalities occurred in fiscal 2023. One contractor lost their  life due to burns sustained in an arc-flash incident, and  another contractor passed away after being struck by a piling  rig\u2019s leg. Among the other two contractor fatalities, one  occurred during ventilation maintenance using a lifting  platform, and the other during work on a construction site  while using a mobile scaffold.

Joint contribution to our health and safety approach Our people contribute to our joint health and safety approach  every day. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for imple- menting health and safety due to differing requirements,  tasks, and work situations throughout the company. Recog- nizing this, we want to involve our employees in the design  and implementation of our health and safety initiatives and  programs. The active participation of our people enables our  company-wide, country-specific, and business-specific initia- tives and programs to thrive. For instance, psychosocial risks  are assessed once a year via the work well-being factors  embedded in the Siemens Global Engagement Survey  (SGES)1. The relevant teams then discuss and document the  risks, opportunities, and measures, and outcomes in a struc- tured follow-up process. 5.4 Occupational health and safety management"}, {"knowledge": "1 Siemens without SHS. 5.5Corporate citizenship \u2013 Improving people\u2019s living conditions\u2013 Giving societies access to knowledge and   technologies \u2013 A variety of projects with three strategic priorities  Management approach Corporate citizenship has been an integral part of Siemens  from the very beginning, with the aim to empower people  and societies. As defined by Werner von Siemens over  175 years ago, the company\u2019s mission is to provide technol- ogies that improve quality of life and create lasting value for  society based on our portfolio, knowledge, and expertise. In  alignment with this mission, our corporate citizenship pro- gram aims to positively impact society in every country  where we operate through voluntary work. The foundation for our approach are the UN\u2019s Sustainable  Development Goals. We identify key topics for our respective  countries, derive specific actions and illustrate how we are  making a positive contribution to achieving them. This  approach allows Siemens to focus primarily on giving back to  the societies where we operate. Our governance and policies for corporate citizenship Responsibility for selecting and managing non-profit and  socially impactful activities lies with the local departments or  management teams in each country. This approach helps to  provide support and create value where it is needed most.  Simultaneously, we combine in-depth local knowledge with  long-term commitment to overcome social challenges that  vary from region to region.  Along with six other international Siemens foundations and  Siemens  Caring Hands e.V., the Siemens Stiftung comple- ments our corporate citizenship initiatives.  Siemens believes that it is important to work for the good  of society beyond our business activities and to invest in  charitable work. This belief is anchored in our Corporate  Citizenship Strategy. Our principles serve as a global frame- work and provide guidance for local sponsorship activities,  donations, charitable contributions, and memberships. This  guidance defines how a variety of potential contributions  can be deployed connecting each one to our overarching  principles. Our own Corporate Volunteering Standard describes a com- mon global corporate citizenship concept and framework  which is supported by an internal volunteering platform  being launched in fiscal 2023. Targets As an important element of our sustainability strategy, cor- porate citizenship is embedded in the DEGREE sustainability  framework.1 By strengthening our identification of different  target groups for our corporate citizenship activities and  offering a range of training measures covering all phases of  life, we contribute to two of the framework\u2019s fields of action:  Equity and Employability.  In every society where we operate, our ambition is to improve  general living and healthcare conditions, enhance educa- tional and training opportunities for the labor market, and  strengthen social cohesion and cultural identification. At the  same time, we aim to strengthen Siemens\u2019 reputation and  local footprint, increase understanding of our technologies,  and position our company as an attractive employer, while  also laying the foundation for future innovation. 5.5 Corporate citizenship"}, {"knowledge": "Actions and results Scale sustainability impact with a shared value approach  Grounded in our core business and competencies, we have  defined three strategic focus areas for our corporate citizen- ship activities: access to technology, access to education,  and sustaining communities.  In addition to participating in traditional philanthropy, we  leverage our technological expertise, capabilities, and prod- ucts to contribute to society.  Access to technology on the basis of our core competencies We want to share our knowledge about automation, digita- lization, and intelligent infrastructure with the intention of  making it accessible to people around the world.  This knowledge is especially important in developing coun- tries, where it can help meet the fundamental needs of local  societies, including energy supply, clean water, and basic  medical care. The objective is to help these societies improve  their overall quality of life and develop new perspectives for  solving problems in the future.  In addition, by equipping research laboratories with control  and automation equipment in countries like Hungary, Turkey,  and Latvia, Siemens is helping improve educational and  employment opportunities.  In fiscal 2023, we worked with TANSAM, the Tamilnadu  Smart and Advanced Manufacturing Centre, to build and  equip an incubation center in India to spur industrial inno- vation at the grassroot level. The center employs under- privileged people and has already trained more than 16,000  students on Industry 4.0 skills.  Donating refurbished laptops to people in need is another  element in our aspiration to help transform communities for a  better tomorrow. People in need can connect and interact with  others and at the same time get access to quality education. Access to education is crucial for societies around the world Our commitment to education encompasses diverse activi- ties and includes STEM-oriented training and promoting  excellence through competition to providing free software  licenses and setting up new institutional education paths,  including dual education and apprenticeship systems.  With the aid of our core competencies in digitalization, automation, and electrifica-tion, as well as scientific research, we strive to give as many people as possible the chance to use the latest technologies. Knowledge is a resource on which our  future depends. Therefore, improving  educational prospects and allowing broad access to  education are critically important challenges for all societies everywhere in the world.  Our goals are to establish stable living condi-tions, protect values, unleash creativity, improve intercultural understanding, and contribute to progress. Our Core Areas Access to technology Access to education Sustaining communities 5.5 Corporate citizenship"}, {"knowledge": "The promotion of education can take different forms and  pursue different objectives: However, the primary objective  remains consistent. We aim to provide enhanced equal  access to future opportunities, and to give young people the  tools to master future challenges. Coding skills are increasingly relevant to helping people and  organizations overcome the challenges of digitalization. As  such, Siemens supports a diverse range of programming-  oriented learning programs and projects designed for  children. These include UBBU in Portugal, Hacker School in  Germany, and Project Jigyaasa in India. Many of these pro- grams are supported by volunteers from Siemens staff. In addition to the programs mentioned above, in fiscal 2023  we supported the Innovation4Sustainability bootcamp, a  local initiative for more than 30 students from public STEM  schools across Egypt. The bootcamp was designed and  developed with the intention of solving industrial waste  management challenges in the electronics sector by empow- ering a group of diverse students through a series of  hands-on trainings, workshops, and ideation using an agile  methodology throughout the bootcamp. In Argentina, we worked with the Siemens Foundation Argen- tina to design a 30-hour internationally certified training pro- gram based on Siemens\u2019 3D design software. The program  provides an up-to-date technical education that meets the  needs and requirements of the socio-productive sector and  aims to enhance employability by helping bridge the digital  divide for more than 2,500 students and 250 teachers. Sustaining communities is key for social cohesion Siemens believes that identification with one\u2019s local cultural  heritage is important for social cohesion. With this objective  in mind, we support cultural and social activities. The  Siemens Arts Program contributes to this objective with a  diverse range of projects: for example, support for the first  Namibian opera designed to promote intercultural under- standing. In addition, we help local communities create safe  and stable environments. For instance, in fiscal 2023, we  provided accommodations at our company premises in  Warsaw to Ukrainian refugees. We are continuously striving to improve our impact on social  cohesion. A major challenge in recent years included unfore- seen events like the global pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  To help those affected, we launched a charity program in  Germany and will continue to roll it out in other countries to  better coordinate our measures and offer our people options  for help. Siemens Stiftung: Working for sustainable social development  Siemens Stiftung is an internationally operating foundation  established by Siemens in 2008 as an independent nonprofit  organization. The foundation focuses on three key themes:  Access to Essential Services, Connected Societies and Climate  and Sustainability, and adopts a proactive approach to   shaping the transformation required by these challenges. By  working with partners in the fields of education, social  entrepreneurship, and culture, the foundation reinforces  collective learning and locally based sustainable structures.  The foundation works with the income from its \u20ac390 million  endowment as well as additional partner funding in Africa,  Europe, and Latin America. Siemens and its employees supported Siemens Stiftung\u2019s  projects with a number of donation campaigns during the  fiscal year. One example is the COVID-19 Aid Fund, which  supported the \u201cSTEM Education for Innovation\u201d initiative  launched by Siemens Stiftung to advance innovative educa- tion formats in Latin American countries. To date it has spent  \u20ac0.75 million on projects that included producing 467 digital  and analog instructional media for the entire educational  chain and providing more training for more than 245,000  STEM teachers and other interested participants in more  than 300 trainings, workshops, and webinars. The fund also  supported the creation of a multi-stakeholder network that  promotes STEMplus education in 14 mainly Latin American  countries as well as the education portal \u201cCREA\u201d (Centro de  Recursos Educativos Abiertos), which offers more than 1,700  open educational resources for STEM lessons.  5.5 Corporate citizenship"}, {"knowledge": "In the fifth edition of the Cents4Sense program, employee  shareholders around the world were able to donate up to  five dividends from their Siemens shares, with the company  matching every donation.

The Sustainability Report 2023 (below, the  \u201cReport\u201d) supplements our financial reporting for fiscal  2023. The present chapter describes the key elements of our  sustainability reporting. Reporting approach The Report explains the strategy, organization, initiatives,  programs, management approach, targets, actions, and  results of sustainable corporate governance. It supplements  the financial reporting provided in the current Annual Report  and updates the financial reporting from the previous year.  It also documents the progress we have made in implement- ing the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact,  the United Nations CEO Water Mandate, and the recommen- dations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial   Disclosures (TCFD). This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Stan- dards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 2021) and the  anti-corruption reporting recommendations of the Global  Compact from Transparency International. Our reporting on  human rights activities is based on the UN Guiding Principles  (UN GP) Reporting Framework and the corresponding guide- lines.  Reporting period and Report boundaries This Report refers to the Siemens 2023 fiscal year (October 1,  2022, to September 30, 2023). Any exceptions are indicated  as such. In general, the Report covers all our fully consoli- dated companies. As a general rule, minority interests are  not included in the Report. Unless otherwise noted, the key  indicators and information reported here relate to the com- pany\u2019s ongoing operations. Some management approaches  do not cover all Siemens entities or parts of the organization.  Some parts of the Siemens organization may have intro- duced specific programs or initiatives that differ from the  general approaches described in this Report.  Nonetheless, they are consistent with the DEGREE sustain- ability framework and the global nonfinancial programs and  initiatives at Siemens. Data collection Given the size and worldwide presence of Siemens, data  collection poses a logistical challenge. Moreover, our compa- nies throughout the world need to comply with national  regulations on the compilation and definition of their key  figures, which means that the generated data is not always  comparable. Where applicable, we point out any significant  limitations in the information presented in the Report.  The data presented in this Report is collected via various  internal reporting systems, which for the most part are dif- ferent from those used to collect the financial information  presented in our consolidated financial statements. In partic- ular, the internal reporting systems used to collect the  information presented in this Report may be subject to less  stringent internal requirements for documentation, data  generation, and auditing, including with respect to the IT  systems and controls employed. We reserve the right to  change the internal guidelines applicable to the collection of  the data published in this Report without prior notice. Due to  rounding, some of the numbers presented in this Report may  not add up precisely to the totals presented, and percentages  may not precisely reflect the absolute figures to which they  refer.  7.1 Reporting methodology"}, {"knowledge": "Methodology, environmental reporting, and collection of environmental data Within our environmental information system, in fiscal 2023  we evaluated 250 reports from locations in all relevant  countries where defined threshold values for environmental  management parameters like energy usage, resource usage,  water consumption, and emissions were exceeded. We use  absolute values \u2013 for example, energy consumption in giga- joules \u2013 to measure and monitor our environmental impacts.  We report environmental data for ongoing operations.  Values have been extrapolated where applicable (e.g.,  waste, energy consumption, or emissions) to 100% coverage  in order to reflect total consumption. The extrapolation is  performed on the basis of the area not covered in the report- ing system. The difference represents a share of 20% for the  reporting period. We monitor our environmental impacts at  all environmentally relevant office and production sites on  the basis of environmental data collected on a quarterly  basis. Scope 3 upstream emissions Scope 3 emissions from our supply chain have been calcu- lated using a cross-regional, macroeconomic input-output  model based on our volume of purchased goods and services.  Scope 3 downstream emissions With regard to Scope 3 downstream emissions, we calculated  these emissions in fiscal 2023 in line with the Greenhouse  Gas (GHG) Protocol, and therefore accounted for and  reported the emissions from the use of Siemens offerings  sold or investments made in the reporting year over their  entire use phase duration. For calculating these emissions,  in most cases we apply the global power-mix emissions   factor defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA). For  calculating the emissions of end products and key compo- nents of end products (intermediate products), we apply the  so-called \u201cfinal product approach\u201d defined in the GHG Protocol.  This means that in the case of motors, for example, we take  into account their power loss as well as their effective power.  If we applied the \u201cintermediate product approach\u201d to all  intermediate products \u2013 an approach that in the example of  motors only takes into account their power loss \u2013 the  reported emissions would be lower. We include all Kyoto gases in our emissions calculations:  carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and  sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). To assess the relevance of GHG  emissions other than CO2, they are converted into metric  tons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e). This number is based on the  global warming potential over 100 years of each of the  greenhouse gases compared to the global warming potential  of CO2. We follow the financial control approach to consolidate the  reporting of emissions. The source of the emissions factors applied in the 2023  reporting year is the \u201cIEA Emissions Factors 2022\u201d published  by the International Energy Agency. For example, the global  CO2e emissions factor used for electricity generation only is  461 g CO2e/kWh. If regional calculations are available, local  emissions factors should be used. Customer Avoided Emissions The description of our methodology for calculating  \u201ccustomer  avoided emissions\u201d can be found the Annex on  REPORTING  Methodology, headcount reporting, and collection of employee data Within our global HR reporting, we report headcount num- bers according to our Siemens Corporate Financial Reporting  Guidelines. These Guidelines are embedded in our global HR  reporting standards and HR reporting landscape system  (HRL), which is the basis for employee reporting figures.  \u201cEmployee\u201d refers to every natural person in an active  employment relationship with a fully consolidated Siemens  company. Employees are all internal workforce without  apprentices, students, interns, and other internal workforce.  All employee figures in the Social chapters refer to head- count. For some companies no employee structure data are  available due to data delivery by SGATE (Siemens Global  Adding Tool for Employees), which is a web-based tool for  collecting, storing, and processing headcount figures for  companies that are consolidated but for a short time not  able to deliver employee structure data. This can lead to  minor deviations in breakdown data. 7.1 Reporting methodology"}, {"knowledge": "Employee turnover is defined as the ratio of voluntary and  involuntary exits from Siemens during the fiscal year to the  average number of employees. Voluntary turnover rate is  based on employee decision, whereas Involuntary turnover  rate is based on other reasons, including dismissals, end of  temporary contract, mutual consent, (early) retirement,  death, and other reasons that are not the employee\u2019s decision.  Hiring rate is defined as the ratio of hirings into the Siemens  group during the fiscal year to the average number of  employees. The headcount numbers and rates for  employees  in management positions include all managers with disci- plinary responsibility, but without Management Board  Members (MBM). Independent assurance Our sustainability reporting is subject to high quality stan- dards. Therefore, as in previous years, we commissioned an  independent audit firm to conduct a limited assurance of our  Sustainability Report 2023. The results of the assurance  conducted by Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs- gesellschaft are presented in the chapter titled \u201cIndependent  auditor\u2019s limited assurance report.\u201d Editor\u2019s note An effort has been made to use gender-neutral language  throughout. Nevertheless, if on occasion the masculine form  is used for easier readability, it stands for people of all genders. 7.1 Reporting methodology"}, {"knowledge": "7.2Reporting principles for Customer Avoided Emissions For 15 years (until fiscal 2021), we reported the revenue  generated from our Environmental Portfolio and the result- ing annual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)  achieved by our customers on the basis of the internal regu- lations defined in our Environmental Portfolio Guideline.  Starting in fiscal 2022, we began to report key figures for  sustainable activities, including revenue, in accordance with  the new EU Taxonomy regulation. We are also continuing to  calculate and report on Customer Avoided Emissions.  GHG Use Phase Impact Reporting Guideline The Siemens GHG Use Phase Impact Reporting Guideline sets  out basic requirements and guidelines for calculating and  reporting emissions associated with the use of products,  systems, solutions, and services sold and investments made  by Siemens. It covers: \u2192 Scope 3 downstream GHG emissions resulting from the  use of sold products (Category 11) and investments   (Category 15) according to the GHG Protocol Corporate  Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard (GHG Protocol Standard) \u2192 Customer Avoided Emissions (according to Siemens\u2019 own  methodology The following summary will focus on the second part, the  calculation and reporting of Customer Avoided Emissions.  Customer Avoided Emissions result either from products,  systems, solutions, and/or services sold by Siemens or from  investments made by Siemens Financial Services (SFS). Customer Avoided Emissions A company\u2019s carbon footprint does not measure the company\u2019s  contribution to decarbonization by its partners and customers.  Although the carbon footprint can indeed reflect emissions  reductions resulting from the use of its solutions (Scope 3  downstream emissions) over time, it does not indicate  whether these solutions have enabled the customer to  achieve lower emissions than an alternative solution (refer- ence scenario). Quantifying the decarbonization impact  resulting from the use of the company\u2019s products and solu- tions (avoided emissions) helps convey a full picture of the  company\u2019s contribution to global decarbonization. The term \u201cCustomer Avoided Emissions\u201d refers to the \u201cposi- tive\u201d impact determined by comparing the GHG emissions of  two different solutions or scenarios. Avoided emissions are  emissions that are saved or avoided during the customer use  phase from the use of our products or financing compared to  a baseline (reference scenario). The guideline used for calculating and reporting Customer  Avoided Emissions is based on a methodology defined by  Siemens itself due to the lack of a commonly used external  definition or standard. It is aligned with the GHG Scope 3  downstream reporting according to the GHG Protocol Standard. Calculation principles The calculation principles are based on the standards \u201cA Cor- porate Accounting and Reporting Standard \u2013 Revised Edition\u201d  and \u201cGHG Protocol for Project Accounting,\u201d both published  by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative. These principles  are relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency,  accuracy, and conservativeness. All Siemens Businesses and SFS are required to apply these  principles in order to enable the integrity and credibility of  the data and a true and fair presentation of Siemens\u2019 Customer  Avoided Emissions. Accounting boundaries The accounting boundaries for data on Customer Avoided  Emissions only encompass the phase during which a prod- uct, system, solution, or service is used by the customer or  the term of an investment. Therefore, GHG emissions occur- ring during other phases of the lifecycle \u2013 for instance, in the  supply chain, in production, or upon end-of-life disposal \u2013  are not included in the calculation.  7.2 Reporting principles for Customer Avoided Emissions"}, {"knowledge": "Accounting for Customer Avoided Emissions All Siemens Businesses and SFS are required to report the  Customer Avoided Emissions for all products, systems, solu- tions, services, or investments that lead to the avoidance of  GHG emissions during the customer use phase. Customer Avoided Emissions represent the difference  between the GHG emissions of a Siemens offering and the  GHG emissions of a baseline or reference scenario. Siemens  Businesses and SFS must account for and report the annual  Customer Avoided Emissions from the use of Siemens offer- ings sold or investments made in the reporting year over the  entire duration of their use phase (\u201cfuture impact of today\u2019s  revenue\u201d similar to Scope 3 use phase emissions according  to the GHG Protocol Standard). Exclusion criteria: Before calculating Customer Avoided Emissions, all Siemens  products, systems, solutions, services, and investments need  to be checked against the following exclusion criteria: \u2192 Field of application: No Customer Avoided Emissions may  be accounted for and reported in the military use or  nuclear power application fields. \u2192 Objections and concerns of external stakeholders: If  stakeholders express concerns or objections, internal or  external information is evaluated and appropriate mea- sures are taken. \u2192 Adverse effects: If evidence comes to Siemens\u2019 attention  that a Siemens product, system, solution, service, or  investment causes considerably greater adverse environ- mental impacts elsewhere in the element\u2019s lifecycle,  Customer Avoided Emissions are not calculated. Greenhouse gases considered The accounting for Customer Avoided Emissions includes,  where appropriate, all six greenhouse gases defined in the  Kyoto Protocol (so-called \u201cKyoto gases\u201d), including: carbon  dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur  hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluo- rocarbons (PFCs). To assess the relevance of GHG emissions other than CO2,  they are converted into metric tons of CO2 equivalents  (CO2e). This number is based on the global warming potential  over 100 years of the respective greenhouse gas compared  to the global warming potential of CO2. Baseline methodology  The baseline methodology defined in the guideline refers to  the comparison of a Siemens product, system, solution,  service, or investment with a reference situation in the  absence of the Siemens offering. To enable credibility and  avoid overstating the positive effect, the reference scenario  has to represent as best as possible the situation that would  have occurred without the Siemens solution. \u2192 Before\u00adand\u00adafter comparison: Refers to the difference  between an initial customer situation and the situation  after the implementation of a Siemens offering intended  to improve or substitute certain characteristics. This com- parison can be applied, for example, to cases in which a  Siemens solution optimizes a building\u2019s energy consump- tion. \u2192 Direct comparison with a reference technology:  Refers to the difference between the Siemens offering  and a comparable other single technology or predecessor  with a similar purpose. This comparison may be applied,  for example, to new product generations or the electrifi- cation of fossil fuel technologies. \u2192 Comparison with the installed base: Refers to the  difference between the Siemens offering and an average  market solution used for the same or a similar purpose  (market standard). This comparison can be applied, for  example, to renewable energy projects by drawing a  comparison with the average global greenhouse gas  emission factor for electricity generation. Recognition of Customer Avoided Emissions In general, Customer Avoided Emissions are recognized for  products, systems, solutions, services, or investments. In  many cases, however, Siemens delivers only the components  of a complete product, system, solution, service, or invest- ment. In these cases, it is often impossible to directly deter- mine the avoided emissions attributable to the components  during the use phase with the customer. Therefore, Siemens Businesses and SFS need to apply the  following rules when accounting for and reporting Customer  Avoided Emissions: \u2192 Siemens supplies the entire product, system, solution,  service, or investment: Siemens accounts for 100% of the  Customer Avoided Emissions during the customer use  phase. 7.2 Reporting principles for Customer Avoided Emissions"}, {"knowledge": "\u2192 Siemens provides all core component(s), even if they only  represent intermediate products of an end application:  Siemens accounts for 100% of the Customer Avoided  Emissions during the customer use phase. \u2192 Siemens provides some of the core component(s): In the  first step, all core components that are involved with  Customer Avoided Emissions are identified. In the second  step, the Siemens share of the total Customer Avoided  Emissions of the end application is determined by calcu- lating the ratio of Siemens components to the total net  delivery price of all core components. \u2192 Siemens does not provide any of the core components of  a product, system, solution, service, or investment:  Siemens reports no Customer Avoided Emissions. Optional accounting of Customer Avoided Emissions So far, there are no robust calculation approaches to quantify  the decarbonization effect of all portfolio elements: for  instance, software or automation technology. Some Siemens  products, systems, solutions, or services are \u201cenabling tech- nologies\u201d and do not demonstrate a direct decarbonization  effect on the product-level. Nevertheless, these enabling  technologies can often be critical components needed for  the transition to a low-carbon economy. One example are  solutions from Smart Infrastructure which can facilitate the   system transformation to an electrification of the global  energy system. Therefore, quantifying these enabling decar- bonization impacts requires calculation approaches on a  system level where these components are built in. Due to the  lack of a commonly used external definition or standard, in  fiscal 2023 Siemens began to account for these \u201cindirect\u201d or  \u201cenabling\u201d decarbonization effects but has decided to report  them separately for the purpose of transparency and conser- vativeness. The same accounting principles are applied as  described above. With regard to the example from Smart  Infrastructure, the calculation to determine the contribution  to electrification and therefore decarbonization is based on  the total global energy use and the share of electrification  and automation solutions from Smart Infrastructure as part  of the total global investment in electrification. The eligible  revenue, based on the EU Taxonomy, is included in the   calculation along with the grid mix evolution of electricity  generation. Calculation Siemens Businesses and SFS are required, where applicable,  to report Customer Avoided Emissions associated with all  products, systems, solutions, services, or investments that  lead to the avoidance of emissions in the customer use  phase. The amount of Customer Avoided Emissions is the  difference between the GHG emissions of the given Siemens  offering and the reference scenario defined above. Technical parameters and assumptions The calculation of Customer Avoided Emissions is based on  different parameters in order to best reflect the amount of  avoided emissions during the entire use phase of a Siemens  offering, similar to the calculation of downstream Scope 3  emissions. The calculation parameters (e.g., emission factors  or expected use phase duration) should be reviewed and  updated regularly in order to reflect the most current status  of these numbers. The calculation approach should be   consistent with the calculation of downstream Scope 3  emissions  (Categories 11 and 15). In some cases, the actual parameters, like the product\u2019s  operating time or intended intensity of use by the customer,  cannot be reliably determined. Under these circumstances,  conservative estimates should be applied and documented  appropriately. In general, the emissions of the reference  scenario and the Siemens offering should include the poten- tial development of the situation over time. The calculation  of future emissions from products with long lifespans is  subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Using an energy  scenario to describe a changing emission factor would lead  to incomparable calculation results whenever the scenario is  updated. Therefore, we decided to use the annually updated  emission factors, which incorporate the changes in the  global energy mix from year to year, in a manner consistent  with the calculation of our downstream Scope 3 emissions. The source of the emission factors applied in the 2023  reporting year is the \u201cIEA Emission Factors 2022\u201d published  by the International Energy Agency. For example, the global  CO2e emissions factor used for electricity generation only is  461 g CO2e/kWh. 7.2 Reporting principles for Customer Avoided Emissions"}, {"knowledge": "If regional calculations are available, local emissions factors  should be used. Offerings with no material Customer Avoided Emissions  impact, or in cases where the calculation cannot be reliably  determined when applying reasonable cost-benefit consid- erations, are not considered in the accounting. Recalculation To enable consistency, especially over time, Siemens Busi- nesses and SFS recalculate the Customer Avoided Emissions  in accordance with the guideline. Events that lead to relevant  changes in the data on Customer Avoided Emissions typically  include corporate mergers, acquisitions, and divestments,  mistakes in previous calculations, changes in external stan- dards or in the Siemens calculation methodology, significant  changes in the parameters and assumptions applied in the  calculation, and any other events that lead to material  changes in calculation estimates. 7.2 Reporting principles for Customer Avoided Emissions"}, {"knowledge": "7.3Our contribution to sustainable development of societies  \u2013 Effective influence in achieving UN\u2019s Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) \u2013 SDGs included in our DEGREE sustainability   framework The United Nations\u2019 17 Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) and their 169 targets serve as a compass for the  change efforts that must be made by governments, busi- nesses, cities, and civil society as a whole if we are to achieve  a more sustainable future.

In particular, this is supported by our corporate  purpose of \u201cWe create technology to transform the everyday,  for everyone.\u201d The UN\u2019s 17 SDGs have therefore become  fixtures in our everyday business. Siemens deploys its tech- nology portfolio to support the public and private sectors in  the digital transformation of industry, building and network  infrastructures, mobility, and healthcare and can offer exten- sive business opportunities for value-enhancing growth. At  the same time, we provide cost-effective, innovative solutions  for the transition to carbon neutrality. These technologies  support customers in achieving their objectives while   consuming fewer resources. To varying extents, Siemens  helps achieve most of the SDGs in the UN\u2019s Agenda 2030 in  four important ways: \u2192 through our products and solutions, \u2192 by doing business responsibly, \u2192 through our expertise and thought leadership, and \u2192 through our corporate citizenship activities and   community engagement. How we contribute to achieving the SDGs From a global perspective, these are the SDGs where Siemens  has a high or medium impact: Goal 3 \u2013 Ensure healthy lives and promote  well-being for all at all ages  We make a significant impact on SDG 3 with our business  portfolio, especially through SHS and the production tech- nologies we provide to pharmaceutical companies. In addition  to the impact of our portfolio, we also care about the health  and safety of our people and contract workers. Separately  from SHS, Siemens sets ambitious goals for access to  Employee Assistance Programs and for reducing employee  accident rates (Lost time injury frequency rate \u2013 LTIFR). We  also participate in health-related community engagement  activities like cancer awareness campaigns and mobile clinics.

Siemens  was one of the world\u2019s first industrial firms to commit to  making its own business activities carbon neutral by 2030.  In addition to reducing emissions from Siemens' operations  without SHS by 55% by 2025 and by 90% by 2030, we also  strive to lower all emissions associated with us \u2013 from our  supply chain throughout the entire use phase of our prod- ucts. Siemens without SHS is committed to a 20% reduction  in emissions in its supply chain by 2030 compared to 2020  and aims to achieve a CO2 neutral supply chain by 2050.  With its commitment to science-based targets, Siemens  supports the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement to limit  climate change to 1.5\u00b0C (Science-Based Target Initiative,  including SHS). Goal 16 \u2013 Promote peaceful and inclusive societ- ies for sustainable development, provide access  to justice for all, and build effective, accountable,  and inclusive institutions at all levels We anchor integrity and compliance throughout our company  and advance the Siemens Integrity Initiative with external  stakeholders. By these means and through our activities with  other players, we support fair competition and ensure our  company\u2019s long-term success. Siemens is committed to  incorporating the requirements of the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC), the Human Rights Declaration, and all  other relevant regulations into our supply chain and to pro- moting their principles through our work with external  organizations and institutions. Goal 17 \u2013 Strengthen the means of implementa- tion and revitalize the Global Partnership for  Sustainable Development  As a global company and an advocate of free trade, we  believe that partnerships are a key to sustainable develop- ment and to our company\u2019s success. We also recognize the  importance of digitalization, project financing, and public-  private partnerships for sustainable development. In all of  these areas, we are partnering with international organiza- tions, business organizations, think tanks, nongovernmental  organizations (NGOs), and academia, including the UNGC,  World Economic Forum (WEF), econsense, Transparency  International, and numerous universities. 7.3 Our contribution to sustainable development of societies"}, {"knowledge": "7.4Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial Disclosure (TCFD)  The G20 Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-  Related Financial Disclosure provides a uniform framework  that companies can voluntarily use to report their climate-  related risks and opportunities and disclose the correspond- ing information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other  stakeholders. This Annex provides an overview of Siemens\u2019  activities based on these recommendations and offers refer- ences to other sources of relevant information. Our governance in the area of climate action Governance at the Managing Board level  At Siemens, sustainability is rooted in all that we do, includ- ing our business purpose and strategy, corporate culture,  processes, and guidelines. The management of sustainability  matters is embedded across our Siemens businesses, Service  and Governance units, and countries. Sustainability has also  been an integral component of management compensation  since fiscal 2020. Put simply, we strive to make sustainability  everyone\u2019s responsibility at Siemens. As the top management body, the Managing Board is  responsible for serving the company\u2019s best interests and for  achieving sustainable growth in company value. The Managing  Board members are responsible for the entire management  of the company and decide on key issues of business policy  and corporate strategy.  The Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Managing  Board in its management of the company\u2019s business. The  Supervisory Board meets regularly to discuss business devel- opment, planning, strategy, and the implementation of that  strategy. In 2023, we significantly strengthened our sustainability  organization throughout the company by introducing the  Sustainability Executive Committee (EC SUS) and Heads of  Sustainability in key businesses and business units, and we  increased the responsibility of the Global Head of Sustain- ability (Global Head of SUS) and the Siemens Sustainability  department. The Managing Board addresses sustainability-related risks  and opportunities of strategic and company-wide impor- tance and adopts appropriate measures. The Managing  Board also approves any changes to the DEGREE sustainability  framework. The Siemens Sustainability Board (SSB) monitors and  resolves Siemens\u2019 sustainability topics, including tracking  the progress of our DEGREE ambition, providing input and  guidance on sustainability reporting, and acting as a catalyst  for regional sustainability initiatives with the potential to  scale across Siemens. The SSB is composed of representa- tives from Siemens\u2019 businesses, countries, and Service and  Governance units. The SSB meets four times per year or  more frequently as needed. The SSB provides updates and  recommendations to the Managing Board. Topics associated with climate change appeared regularly on  the agenda of EC SUS and SSB meetings in fiscal 2023 and  included, for example, our Net Zero Operations Program  implementation or product-related decarbonization efforts. The Sustainability Executive Committee (EC SUS) acts as  guidance body for Siemens sustainability business \u2013 the  Siemens portfolio that enables positive sustainability impact  by addressing and financing (i) decarbonization and energy  efficiency, (ii) resource efficiency and circularity as well as  (iii) people centricity and social impact \u2013 with a focus on  portfolio market segments and go-to-market topics, and it  meets on an ad hoc basis to discuss relevant subjects.  Chaired by Siemens\u2019 CEO, the EC SUS includes Siemens\u2019 CSO,  the CEOs of key businesses, Chief Strategy Officer, General  Counsel, and Global Head of SUS. The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) oversees Siemens\u2019  sustainability topics. The CSO is a member of the Siemens  Managing Board, chairs the Siemens Sustainability Board  (SSB), and is a member of the Sustainability Executive Com- mittee (EC SUS). The CSO is also responsible for the Siemens  Sustainability department. 7.4 Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)"}, {"knowledge": "In addition to our strategic sustainability activities, the CSO  ensures that we operate in compliance with our environ- mental guidelines. Our EHS Principles serve as internal  binding guidelines for this purpose. Siemens has also  founded expert panels to ensure that environmental consid- erations are integral to our decision-making. The Global  Board EHS is composed of subject-matter experts who  develop environmental protection measures and programs  and provide advice to the Chief People and Sustainability  Officer in consultation with the Siemens Sustainability Board. Governance at the business and management levels The Global Head of Sustainability (Global Head of SUS) leads  the Siemens Sustainability department. In this capacity, the  Global Head of SUS reports to the CSO on all Siemens   sustainability topics excluding sustainability business and  related strategy topics. For the latter topics, the Global Head  of SUS reports to Siemens\u2019 CEO. The Global Head of SUS is a  regular member of the SSB. The Global Head of SUS regularly  informs the Supervisory Board on sustainability matters. The Siemens Sustainability department is responsible for  developing our DEGREE sustainability framework in coordi- nation with the SSB, businesses, Service and Governance  units, and countries and controlling the DEGREE target  achievements. Responsibility for sustainability reporting and  the Net Zero Operations Program also lies with the Sustain- ability department. It also governs the purchase of carbon  offsets and the Sustainability Risk Due Diligence Process. The  Sustainability department also supports sustainability initia- tives with scalability across Siemens. This includes developing  the processes, training, and tools needed to address over- arching sustainability topics for our countries, businesses,  and Service and Governance units in collaboration with other  Siemens organizations. Finally, the Sustainability department  is responsible for developing strategic considerations for the  Siemens sustainability business in alignment with the   Managing Board, EC SUS, and the CEOs. CEOs are ultimately responsible for all sustainability topics in  their area of responsibility. This includes responsibility for  the sustainability business, implementation of DEGREE,  sustainability reporting, the Sustainability Risk Due Diligence  Process, and other related responsibilities.  The CEOs of Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Siemens  Mobility, and Siemens Financial Services (SFS) are supported  by their respective Heads of SUS to achieve their sustainabil- ity mandates. The Heads of SUS also assist the Global Head  of SUS with their responsibilities in the Sustainability depart- ment, as they pertain to their businesses. Heads of SUS have  a governance reporting line to the Global Head of SUS in  addition to their reporting line to their respective CEOs. The  Heads of SUS are appointed by the respective CEOs, in align- ment with the Global Head of SUS. In addition, the CEOs of the business units in Digital Industries,  Smart Infrastructure, Siemens Mobility, and SFS each appoint  Sustainability Managers who have a governance reporting  line to the Heads of SUS and to their reporting line to their  respective CEOs. Lead Country SUS Managers support their respective Lead  Country CEOs and their assigned countries. They also lead  Siemens\u2019 sustainability topics within the scope of responsi- bility of the Lead Country management. Our Service and Governance units are responsible for the  ongoing development of sustainability-related topics within  their own mandate in line with the DEGREE sustainability  framework and regulatory and organizational requirements. Lastly, Sustainability Risk Due Diligence Subject Matter  Experts are appointed by and support Digital Industries,  Smart Infrastructure, Siemens Mobility, and SFS to responsibly  conduct the Sustainability Risk Due Diligence Process. Siemens\u2019 Environmental Council assesses Siemens\u2019 environ- mental risks, opportunities, and trends based on uniform  criteria and reports them to the Siemens Enterprise Risk  Management. The council is composed of environmental  experts from our business units and countries as well as  experts in corporate governance, environmental protection,  supply chain, sustainability, finance, technology, real estate,  and insurance. 7.4 Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)"}, {"knowledge": "Our strategic response to climate-related opportunities and risks The DEGREE sustainability framework includes the sustain- ability-related topics important for Siemens, including  decarbonization and resource efficiency, for which we have  set ambitious targets (see paragraph \u201cMetrics and targets\u201d).  These targets, in conjunction with our overall Science-Based  Targets initiative-validated (SBTi) decarbonization target,  apply to Siemens\u2019 own operations and to our upstream and  downstream value chain. We have officially adopted sustainability as an additional  strategic imperative for our investment decisions. Siemens is a leading technology company with a portfolio  designed to drive the digital and sustainable transformation  of industry, infrastructure, mobility, and healthcare. We  firmly believe that technology is the answer to creating a  sustainable future. As key pillars of our strategy, digitalization  and sustainability help future-proof our business and that of  our customers. To further increase our positive impact, we believe that  working in ecosystems is the best way to jointly create seam- less solutions for our customers and their specific challenges. Siemens\u2019 business is focused on enabling customers to  achieve a positive sustainability and climate-related impact  along the following value propositions: Decarbonization & energy efficiency We support our customers with their efforts to decarbonize  their infrastructure and operations, drive energy efficiency,  and future-proof entire industries. We do this by offering  products, systems, solutions, and services that are based on  our strategic focus on digitalization, electrification, and  automation. For example, our energy-efficient products and  solutions support the transition from fossil fuels to renew- able energy sources, and our electrification solutions enable  renewable grid integration and the electrification of heat  and hydrogen. Across industries, we offer energy optimiza- tion and carbon footprint management throughout our  products\u2019 lifecycles and supply chains. In buildings, we offer  energy efficiency and decarbonization solutions, such as  smart buildings and smart energy management for a reduced  carbon footprint. Our rail systems offer low-carbon mobility  and increased energy efficiency. Resource efficiency & circularity Through their use of our digital technology, our customers  can achieve resource efficiency and profitability. For  instance, we harness digitalization to reduce the require- ments of physical assets and resources. We combine the real  and the digital worlds with our digital twin technology, a  virtual representation of a physical product or process that is  used to simulate, predict, and optimize its physical counter- part. Digital twins enable users to do more with fewer  resources and make current and future environmental foot- prints transparent. Our building solutions also contribute to  optimized space utilization and ultimately increase resource  efficiency. Our mobility solutions focus on enhanced net- work capacity and extended lifecycles. Climate\u00adrelated opportunities and risks Climate-related opportunities and risks are integrated into  our company-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)   process. ERM at Siemens is based on a net risk approach in  which the risks and opportunities are addressed that remain  after implementing existing, effective measures and controls. As a global technology company and innovation leader in  the fields of electrification, automation, and digitalization,  Siemens supports sustainable industrialization. These topics  are becoming increasingly important in the transition to a  low-carbon economy \u2013 a development that confirms our  company strategy. Although there are uncertainties about  the impact of climate-related changes, we consider the  transition to a low-carbon economy as an opportunity. A  favorable political and regulatory environment including the  transition towards a low-carbon economy could restore a  more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports  the growth of our markets. In addition, government initia- tives and subsidies (including tax reforms, green and digital  recovery plans, R&D among others) lead to more government  spending (e.g. infrastructure, healthcare, mobility or digita- lization investments) and may ultimately result in an oppor- tunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue  and profit. Investments to strengthen countries\u2019 resilience,  energy and food security, as well as to diversify value chains  close to major markets (reshoring, nearshoring) can present  opportunities to businesses. By enabling our customers to  reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using our  portfolio and by reducing CO2e emissions in our own opera- tions, Siemens strives to support the transition towards a  7.4 Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)"}, {"knowledge": "low-carbon economy. Siemens also welcomes and supports  recent legislative and governmental measures to accelerate  the mitigation of climate change, especially in Europe such  as through the Green Deal or sustainable finance initiatives. To leverage these climate-related opportunities, we again  included sustainability and decarbonization in this year\u2019s  strategy review, in which we formulated concrete action  plans for our business units in order to support our customers  in achieving their sustainability and decarbonization goals in  an even more targeted fashion. Potential transition risks (e.g., regulation, market, and tech- nology) and physical climate-related risks are assessed in our  risk process. In this process, we have generally identified the  risk of an increasing sustainability focus. Governments  around the world continue to increase their focus on sustain- ability topics, resulting in the risk of increased costs to   comply with new laws and related reporting requirements.  In addition, increasing stakeholder and investor focus on  sustainability topics brings reputational risk should our sus- tainability commitments, targets and activities be perceived  as a deceptive use of green marketing or otherwise not  credible. Climate change litigation has become a worldwide  phenomenon with a corresponding risk to Siemens as a large  corporation. We address these risks in a variety of ways  including through our sustainability framework DEGREE, in  which we have set ambitious sustainability targets. DEGREE  includes measures to reduce our carbon footprint along with  other initiatives addressing ESG topics more generally.  We have implemented an ESG due diligence process that   supports Siemens businesses with due diligence in the  customer- oriented environment with a view to possible  environmental and social risks as well as related human rights  and reputational risks. Finally, we believe our overall portfolio  is very well positioned to meet the current and future   sustainability needs of our customers and the societies in  which we operate.  Analysis of climate\u00adrelated scenarios Different climate-related scenarios are used at Siemens for  different purposes: for instance, for our business strategy  and decarbonization strategy and to identify opportunities  and risks. Our decarbonization target, which is approved by  the Science-Based Targets initiative, is aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C  target and therefore the Paris Agreement.  As described in our  STRATEGY chapter, there are several  megatrends that are driving us to rethink established ways  of doing things. These megatrends and their impacts are  reshaping the needs of our customers and markets. To create  a holistic picture of potential futures, we execute sustainabil- ity scenario analyses that enable us to map impacts and  risks, identify opportunities, and find new ways to create  value through pathways by 2030 and 2040. Strategic  insights are derived from scientific frameworks like the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) Repre- sentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socio- economic Pathways (SSPs) as well as market trends and  expert knowledge. The sustainability scenarios illustrate  different possible development pathways for the global  economy and Siemens\u2019 operating environment, across the  focus topics climate, circularity, biodiversity, and society that  take into account both an organized 1.5\u00b0C and a disorganized  3\u00b0C pathway. These scenarios guide the development of our  sustainability strategy. By providing innovative technologies, we see ourselves as a  leading decarbonization partner to our customers and society  in general. To fulfill this role, we need to have a precise  understanding of the technological changes that must be  made in the next few decades and beyond. We rely primarily  on scenarios from S&P Global (formerly IHS Markit), IEA, and  BloombergNEF to plan our business strategy and identify  company-wide risks and opportunities. These scenarios help  us, for example, to identify trends in the energy and mobility  markets. For business planning purposes, we apply different  scenarios like the S&P Global Green Rules (our baseline   scenario), Inflections, and two net zero scenarios (ACCS, MTM);  and IEA STEPS, APS, NZE, and BloombergNEF New Energy  Outlook (Economic Transition Scenario, net zero scenario).  These scenarios help us predict market developments, assess  the implications of various scenarios, and make business  decisions on this basis. With a view to our own business,  analyzing climate-related scenarios allows us to predict the  potential consequences in terms of regulatory requirements,  R&D, and customer trends and requirements. Our business  units also conduct business-specific scenario analyses.  7.4 Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)"}, {"knowledge": "We also apply different climate scenarios to assess physical  climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraph   \u201cManagement of climate risks in our own operations\u201d).  Our risk management approach to climate-related opportunities and risks Climate-related risks and opportunities are embedded in the  Siemens-wide ERM approach. All identified climate risks are  assessed and measures for risk prevention, transfer, or miti- gation are devised for all relevant risks. Risk management at Siemens builds on a comprehensive,  interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Man- agement (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organi- zation and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our  ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of,  and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could  materially affect the achievement of our strategic, opera- tional, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon  is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach,  addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the   execution of existing and effective measures and controls. A  detailed description of our enterprise risk management basic  principles and process can be found in our combined   management report, chapter 8.2 Risk management. Climate risks in the risk management system The consideration of sustainability and climate-related risks  and opportunities is an integral part of our regular top-down  process that communicates material issues and trends at risk  workshops to the relevant company units so they can identify  risks and opportunities. As a result, issue-related recommen- dations are available to all businesses at their quarterly  reviews. In fiscal 2023, several climate-related topics were  on the agenda of the top-down process, which then provided  input to the annual ERM process on topics that included  physical climate risks, increasing regulation, and the trans- parency of environmental product data.  In conjunction with the bottom-up approach, these measures  enable a comprehensive overview of our business activities  and the related risks and opportunities. Climate change is not treated as a separate category in the  ERM approach; it is considered within the four topic areas of  strategic, operational, financial, and compliance-related  risks. Risk processes have been implemented upstream  throughout the company to assess potential climate-related  net risks for ERM reporting.  Material opportunities and risks are disclosed on an aggre- gated basis within the abovementioned four topic areas in  the Siemens annual report. Management of climate risks in our own operations Climate change mitigation We have set ambitious decarbonization targets that apply to  Siemens\u2019 own operations and to our upstream and down- stream value chain (see paragraph \u201cMetrics and targets\u201d).  The reduction of GHG emissions in our own operations is  integrated into Long-term Incentive (LTI) compensation as  part of an internal Siemens ESG/Sustainability Index that is  applicable to members of the Managing Board and senior  management (Siemens without SHS). Anchoring the reduc- tion of GHG emissions in this system and the responsibility  of each of our businesses for reducing its prorated emissions  are key elements of our management approach and require  regular monitoring.  Climate change adaptation We continuously evaluate the vulnerability of all Siemens  locations regarding acute physical risks based on assess- ments provided by external suppliers and data collected  internally. Through recurrent analyses conducted by Global  Risk Consultants on behalf of T\u00dcV S\u00fcd, it is evident that the  Siemens locations significantly surpass industry standards in  terms of risk protection as per the respective insurer ratings  (industry average: approximately 70, Siemens: approxi- mately 80). Consequently, Siemens locations are consistently  characterized by notably low risk levels. We continuously  conduct local risk assessments and collaborate closely with  various stakeholders to ensure an adequate protection level.  7.4 Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)"}, {"knowledge": "Furthermore, during this fiscal year, we conducted compre- hensive global training sessions, featuring the participation  of qualified external specialists, aimed at strengthening our  business continuity management and standardizing our  business impact analysis, particularly in the context of natural  hazards. These initiatives also consider anticipated changes  in risk exposures due to climate change. Our decision-making process for selecting new locations and  devising sustainable, long-term protective measures is based  on an exhaustive risk analysis, with a particular emphasis on  natural hazards. This includes an in-depth examination and  modeling of current risk factors and future climate scenarios,  facilitating the formulation of proactive measures. In addi- tion to the assessment of physical risks, we engage in  transparent dialogues with partners to comprehensively  evaluate transitional risks, such as regulatory changes,  thereby encompassing associated risks and opportunities. We employ a range of systems and meticulously compare the  parameters acquired from Swiss RE (RDS), Zurich Resilience  Solutions (ZRS), Verizon Maplecroft, among others. In fiscal 2023, we conducted the Do No Significant Harm  (DNSH) assessment with regards to future physical climate  risks in the context of our reporting under the EU Taxonomy  regulation for all activities related to the environmental  objective \u201cClimate Change Mitigation\u201d. The assessment of  physical climate-related risks of all eligible and substantially  contributing activities was conducted by technical experts  on site, supplier, and project type levels. We partnered with  insurers and other external risk data providers to assess  future hazards associated with climate change, e.g. cyclone,  hurricane, typhoon, heavy precipitation, or wildfire, using  the IPCC scenario RCP 4.5. Additionally, we defined and  started to implement measures at locations where signifi- cant risks have been identified.  Climate change is also having an impact on water supply.  Water is one of humanity\u2019s most important resources. For  this reason, Siemens has been analyzing water scarcity,  water pollution, local fire risks, climate change, and flooding  and precipitation patterns at our sites for several years. We  consider these analyses in our business decisions: for example,  when we select the location for a new site or implement  precautionary measures. We establish water targets at multiple sites to account for  the specific local environment and to drive effective mitiga- tion measures. At the corporate level, we have implemented  a defined water strategy, and have conducted risk assess- ments to shape local water targets. The aim of our water strategy is to minimize the adverse  local effects of our water consumption and use. In fiscal  2022, we expanded the analysis of our water-related risks to  include our supply chain. Based on this analysis, we derived  further measures for sustainable water use. Our water risk analysis begins with an assessment of our  environmentally relevant sites using the Aqueduct Water  Risk Atlas from the World Resources Institute (WRI). With the  aid of an internal analytical tool, Siemens assesses local-level  risks resulting from our sites\u2019 activities, and then assesses  them in relation to regional water risks. Sites with a high-risk  assessment need to define targets to reduce the level of risk.  In fiscal 2023, 96% of our sites implemented this water  strategy. Management of climate risks along our value chain Climate change mitigation In addition to our Science-Based Target, we defined a target  in the DEGREE sustainability framework for our upstream  Scope 3 emissions: Siemens without Siemens Healthineers  (SHS) has set a target to reduce CO2e emissions generated in  our supply chain by 20% by 2030 compared to 2020. We also  aim to achieve Net Zero emissions in our supply chain by  2050. Details on our upstream Scope 3 emissions in fiscal  2023 can be found in the chapter  SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN  In our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program, we collaborate  with an external partner to analyze the economic data and  model the carbon footprint of each of our suppliers. To  facilitate this process, we utilize a web-based tool called  supplier+s that highlights the main sources of suppliers\u2019  CO2e emissions and provides guidance on how to reduce  them. Once suppliers have completed the learning phase,  they provide us with their primary data through the tool. 7.4 Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)"}, {"knowledge": "To make our portfolio\u2019s contribution to decarbonization  more transparent, we report the amount of CO2e emissions  that our products and solutions avoid compared to reference  solutions. Customer avoided emissions represent the differ- ence between the CO2e emissions of a Siemens offering and  the CO2e emissions of a baseline or reference scenario. In  fiscal 2023, we helped our customers avoid 190 million  metric tons of CO2e emissions. The Siemens technologies  that make the largest contribution to the avoidance of CO2e  emissions at our customers are frequency converters,   railbound passenger and freight transportation, and building  systems. For a detailed description of our methodology  for calculating customer avoided emissions, please see  We also invested \u20ac6.2 billion (compared to \u20ac5.6 billion in  fiscal 2022) in research and development activities that are  geared towards developing innovative and sustainable solu- tions for Siemens\u2019 customers and businesses, while simul- taneously strengthening our competitive positioning. This is  also how we contribute to society.  COMPANY PROFILE Climate change adaptation We analyze potential risks in our supply chain, including  environmental risks. We centralize sustainability-related  data about our suppliers on the SCM Sustainability Platform,  which enables us to gather information from diverse internal  and external sources. This includes data on carbon reduction  initiatives, corporate responsibility self-assessments (CRSA),  on-site audit results, and risks associated with conflict  minerals.  All employees in Siemens' purchasing departments can  access this integrated tool. Metrics and targets Siemens considers climate-related risks and opportunities  along the entire value chain. Accordingly, we define metrics  for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain,  in the company\u2019s own operations, and in the goods and  services we provide to our customers.  Our validated 1.5\u00b0C Science-Based Target, along with our  DEGREE decarbonization targets and our membership in the  RE100, EV100, and EP100 initiatives, is strengthening our  climate protection strategy. Science-Based Target By joining the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi),  Siemens has pledged to reduce emissions from its own  operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 50% and its value chain  (Scope 3) by 15% by 2030 compared to 2019. Our commit- ment to the SBTi is aimed at aligning our business activities  with the 1.5\u00b0C decarbonization pathway under the terms of  recognized climate models to ensure that our greenhouse  gas emissions will be consistent with the Paris Climate  Agreement\u2019s 1.5\u00b0C target. DEGREE targets As part of our DEGREE sustainability framework (without  Siemens Healthineers), we set a goal for all Siemens production  facilities and buildings worldwide and our vehicle fleet to  achieve a Net Zero carbon footprint by 2030. In effect, this  means reducing Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions in Siemens\u2019  business operations for Siemens without Siemens Healthineers  (SHS) by 90% by 2030, compared to 2019. To achieve this  target, Siemens has pledged to invest an additional \u20ac650 million  in its own decarbonization efforts by 2030. Any residual  emissions will then be balanced with high-quality carbon  offsets that meet established standards.  To drive additional transparency on our journey to 2030, we  set an ambitious interim reduction target for our business  operations at Siemens without SHS of 55% by 2025 com- pared to 2019. For scope 3 emissions, Siemens (without Siemens Healthineers)  has set a target to reduce CO2e emissions generated in our  supply chain by 20% by 2030 compared to 2020. We also  aim to achieve Net Zero emissions in our supply chain by  2050. 7.4 Task Force on Climate\u00adRelated Financial  Disclosures (TCFD)"}, {"knowledge": "Our ambitious decarbonization measures and targets in our  own operations and along our value chain are helping elim- inate potential transitional climate risks and increasing our  resilience and the energy independence of our production  facilities. Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program Our Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program addresses environ- mental factors specific to our products, systems, solutions,  and services and our production. It also defines objectives  for improving our environmental management: for example,  by encouraging a circular economy and generally demateri- alizing our business processes. The program has three components:  1)  Robust Eco Design (RED) approach: At the center of the  Responsible Product Development program component  is our Robust Eco Design approach. Our Eco Design  approach is also embedded in the field of action Resource  efficiency in our DEGREE sustainability framework. The  program intends to introduce methods and rules for dema- terialization along the entire value chain. Our aim has  been to intensify the use of lifecycle assessments (LCAs)  and environmental product declarations (EPDs), which  will allow us to identify environmentally compatible  design alternatives that take circularity into account and  can be integrated into product specifications. Our ambi- tion is to apply the RED approach to all relevant products,  systems, solutions, and services by 2030. This is associ- ated with our goal to increase the number of LCAs and  EPDs available.  2)  Clean Supply Chain: Building on the RED phase demate- rialization, the Clean Supply Chain category in the Eco  Efficiency @ Siemens program maps our path to decou- pling natural resource use from our economic growth.  That is why we will increasingly source secondary mate- rials and take action to replace regulated substances  according to IEC 62474. We want to proportionately  increase our procurement of secondary metal and resins  by 2030. To achieve this, we are concentrating on suppliers  of raw materials and semifinished products that can be  directly influenced by our purchasing specifications. 3)  Efficient Own Operations: The component Efficient Own  Operations of our Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program  aims to reduce the environmental impact of our sites  through dematerialization and circular economy princi- ples. We focus on improving our energy efficiency and  reducing the environmental impact of the waste we  generate. When it comes to environmentally responsible  energy use, we focus on reducing emissions from power  generation in addition to minimizing energy consump- tion itself.

We are continuing to support the  Mandate in two ways: by managing water efficiently at our  own facilities and by providing solutions that help our   customers handle water and wastewater more efficiently. Our own activities We are continuing to implement the approach to water  resource management that we developed in 2012. This  includes monitoring factors like water scarcity, water pollution,  flooding, environmental fire risks, and consequences of climate  change as well as performing site-specific risk analyses.  Individual goals and measures are defined for locations with  high water-related risks. This approach minimizes the  site-specific adverse impacts of our water consumption by  taking into account local risks like water scarcity, water   pollution, and flooding in environmentally sensitive areas.  You can find out more about conserving resources and water  consumption at Siemens\u2019 locations in the  ENVIRONMENT   section of this report. We use resources carefully. For example, Siemens India has  implemented sustainable water management by applying  various measures, including utilizing water-efficient appli- ances, installing rainwater harvesting system at four major  factory locations, and building water reclamation facilities  (zero liquid discharge facilities) that enable us to reduce  freshwater consumption and use treated water for landscaping  and toilet flushing. Our supply chain partners  The environmental protection requirements for our supply  chain partners are set out in the Siemens Group Code of  Conduct for Siemens Suppliers and Third Party Intermediaries.  More information on these requirements and on supply  chain management is available in the  SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY  CHAIN PRACTICES section of this report. Our customers We support our customers with water management solu- tions, including the following. Leak detection Non-revenue water not only impacts the economic perfor- mance of water supply companies; it also increases pressure  on natural water resources, because more water is produced  and processed than is actually needed. Thanks to our techno- logical innovations, Siemens can detect leaks with the help  of AI. Leaks in the pipeline network were responsible for  about 10% of the water supplied by the Swedish water  company VA SYD that never reached consumers. With SIWA  LeakPlus, VA SYD now relies on artificial intelligence (AI) to  detect and repair leaks in its water distribution networks. Virtual process control system  Thanks to implementing cutting-edge process control tech- nology at the waste management company EGLV (Emscher  Genossenschaft & Lippe Verband), the customer was able  not only to save operational costs but also to contribute to  the renaturation of the Emscher and Lippe River basins  through sustainable wastewater management. Partnerships to reduce water loss In line with our pledge to be an agile and active market  leader, we go beyond traditional distributorships and  increasingly rely on collaborations in a variety of areas.  We\u2019ve signed collaboration agreements with component  manufacturers like Hach Analytics and with global players  like Acciona (desalination) and young entrepreneurs like  BuntPlanet (digital portfolio). This is how our company and  our partners will be able to meet our customers\u2019 require- ments and offer them a comprehensive, innovative product  and system portfolio, a local presence worldwide, and our  usual high quality while also remaining cost-effective. 7.8 United Nations CEO Water Mandate"}, {"knowledge": "Social commitment  Through our memberships in international organizations, we  participate in numerous initiatives and projects like the  water project on the Action 2020 platform of the World  Business Council for Sustainable Development. We initiate,  implement, and support projects that foster efficient water  use in various regions of the world. The Siemens Stiftung,  Siemens\u2019 nonprofit foundation in Germany, employs an  entrepreneurial approach to supplying communities with  clean drinking water. One example is described below. The WeTu social enterprise in Kenya The WeTu social enterprise founded by Siemens Stiftung  works on innovative solutions for supplying energy and  drinking water to communities in Western Kenya near Lake  Victoria. Its WeWater unit operates 13 water dispensing  stations at various locations that supply the surrounding  rural communities with safe, filtered drinking water at   economical prices. In a multistage process, surface water is processed through  various prefilters, an ultra-filtration membrane, and finally  UV disinfection. Drinking water is dispensed around the  clock by way of a cashless ATM system. This approach supplies  more than 3 million liters of drinking water to 16,000 people.  A variety of social marketing measures also alert customers  about how contamination can occur in home use and how  contaminated drinking water affects health.
