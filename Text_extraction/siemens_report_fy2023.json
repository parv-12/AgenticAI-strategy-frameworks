Organization of the Siemens Group and basis of presentation    Siemens is a technology group that is active in nearly all countries of the world, focusing on the areas of automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, smart mobility solutions for rail transport, and medical technology and digital healthcare services.  Siemens comprises Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a stock corporation under the Federal laws of Germany, as the parent company, and its subsidiaries. Our Company is incorporated in Germany, with our corporate headquarters situated in Munich. As of September 30, 2023, Siemens had around 320,000 employees.  As of September 30, 2023, Siemens has the following reportable segments: Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers, which together form our \u201cIndustrial Business\u201d and Siemens Financial Services (SFS), which supports the activities of our industrial businesses and also conducts its own business with external customers. Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio Companies, which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance.  Our reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue. Such orders and revenue are eliminated on Group level.  Non-financial matters of the Group and Siemens AG  Siemens has policies for environmental, employee and social matters, for the respect of human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery matters, among others. Our business model is described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Combined Management Report. Reportable information that is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, position and the impact of our activities on these matters is included in this Combined Management Report, in particular in chapters 3 through 7. Forward-looking information, including risk disclosures, is presented in chapter 8. Chapter 9 includes additional information that is required to be reported in the Combined Management Report related to the parent company Siemens AG. EU Taxonomy disclosures are outlined in chapter 11.  As supplementary information, amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG related to such non-financial matters, and additional explanations thereto, are included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023, Notes 17, 18, 22, 26 and 27, and in the Notes to the Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2023, Notes 16, 17, 20, 21 and 25. In order to inform the users of the financial reports in a focused manner, these disclosures are not subject to a specific non-financial framework \u2013 in contrast to the disclosures in our separate \u201cSustainability report 2023\u201d document, which are based on the standards developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Said document also includes detailed information on DEGREE, Siemens\u2019 sustainability framework. With DEGREE, Siemens intends to manage and track its progress on selected ambitions in the environmental, social and governance areas."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  4  2. Financial performance system  2.1 Revenue growth  In the Siemens Financial Framework we aim to achieve a revenue growth range of 5% to 7% per year on a comparable basis over a cycle of three to five years. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in our business net of currency translation effects, which arise from the external environment outside of our control, and portfolio effects, which involve business activities which are either new to or no longer a part of the respective business.   Currency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition or a disposition and is calculated as the change year-over-year in revenue related to the transaction. For calculating the percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. Any portfolio effect is excluded for the twelve months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change. For orders, we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.  2.2 Profitability and capital efficiency  Within the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.   For our industrial businesses, profit represents EBITA adjusted for amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations.   We have set the following margin ranges:                 Margin range  Digital Industries 17 - 23%  Smart Infrastructure 11 - 16%  Mobility 10 - 13%  Siemens Healthineers 17 - 21%     Siemens Financial Services (ROE after tax) 15 - 20%              For Siemens Healthineers, we present the margin range we expect as that company\u2019s majority shareholder.  In line with common practice in the financial services business, our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at SFS is return on equity after tax, or ROE after tax. ROE is defined as SFS\u2019 profit after tax, divided by its average allocated equity.  Primary measure for managing and controlling profit and profitability at Group level: Net income is the primary driver of basic earnings per share from net income (EPS) as well as of EPS before purchase price allocation accounting (EPS pre PPA) which is used for our capital market communication. EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. As with EPS, EPS pre PPA includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. We aim to achieve high-single-digit annual growth in EPS pre PPA over a cycle of three to five years.  We seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. For purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens Financial Framework. Our goal is to achieve a ROCE within a range of 15% to 20% over a cycle of three to five years.  2.3 Capital structure  Sustainable revenue and profit development is supported by a healthy capital structure. Accordingly, a key consideration within the Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations). This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be needed to cover Industrial net debt through income from continuing operations, without taking into account interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We aim to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.  2.4 Liquidity and dividend  We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In the Siemens Financial Framework, we strive for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it.  As in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow. Our primary measure to assess our ability to generate cash, and ultimately to pay dividends, is the cash conversion rate for the Siemens Group, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow (continuing and discontinued operations) to net income. Over a cycle of three to five years, we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate.   At the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, the Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, will submit the following proposal to allocate the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for fiscal 2023: to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.70 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend for fiscal 2023 existing at the date of the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting; the remaining amount is to be carried"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  5  forward. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by Siemens shareholders at the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 8, 2024.

Segment information  3.1 Overall economic conditions  Overall, calendar 2023 was characterized by many headwinds for the global economy. Global economic development continued to slowly recover from the negative shocks of the previous years: the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) with its disruptions on global demand and supply chains; war in Ukraine and the following commodity price explosions, especially for European energy; spiraling inflation and severe financial tightening which caused some turbulence in the banking sector and financial markets. After calendar 2022, in which global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 3.1%, calendar 2023 is expected to show global GDP increasing by 2.6%, which shows a remarkable resilience of the global economy, given the number of big negative shocks of the previous year.  In the post-pandemic world, consumption patterns of households continued to normalize. In particular, the shift to goods from services triggered by COVID-19 ended and then reversed, with a strong rebound of the service sector including tourism, and a normalization of goods demand. In addition, in light of much higher interest rates many firms started to reduce their inventory levels, which they had previously elevated as a precautionary measure to ensure production and delivery during periods of supply chain bottlenecks. Accordingly, both global goods demand and trade were significantly weaker in calendar 2023.  These trends were primary contributors for the significant slowdown of the Chinese economy during calendar 2023, after it started very dynamically in the first quarter of calendar 2023 following lifting of severe COVID-19 lockdowns. Another main contributor for the slowdown was the intensification of the country\u2019s real estate crisis. Hence, China\u2019s GDP is expected to grow by only 5% in calendar 2023, which is regarded as low because under multiple lockdowns in calendar 2022, China delivered GDP growth of only 3% and some catching-up in 2023 was expected.  The U.S. economy was a positive surprise. Although monetary policy was substantially tightened and the main policy interest rate was increased to 5.5%, consumption and investment were strong and GDP is expected to expand by 2.5% in calendar 2023. In particular the labor market was robust and unemployment remained at historic lows. Despite the strong economy, inflation and core inflation rates declined substantially. By end of calendar 2023, consumer price inflation is expected to be approximately 3%, after it reached nearly 6.5% at the end of calendar 2022. Receding global commodity and energy prices and the dissolvement of supply chain bottlenecks both helped ease inflation while tighter monetary policy had the desired effect of anchoring inflation expectations. This helped the U.S. avoid a price-wage-price spiral which could have led to structurally higher inflation rates.  While the U.S. showed stronger economic growth than expected, the European Union (E.U.) experienced the difficulties that were widely expected. The drastic increase of energy prices in calendar 2022, a result of the war in Ukraine, had a severe negative impact, especially on energy-intensive industries. Strong increases in inflation rates led the European Central bank to increase the main policy interest rate to 4.5% which weighed on fixed investment, especially in the real estate sector. Moreover, the global manufacturing and trade slowdown mentioned above weighed on the E.U., due in particular to the high concentration of manufacturing and export industries in Germany, the region\u2019s largest economy. GDP growth in calendar 2023 is expected to be 0.4% in the E.U. and -0.4% in Germany. Only the service sector, in particular tourism, supported the overall E.U. economy.  The partly estimated figures presented here for GDP are based on an S&P Global report dated October 15, 2023.  3.2 Digital Industries  Digital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries; these offerings include automation systems and software for factories, numerical control systems, servo motors, drives and inverters and integrated automation systems for machine tools and production machines. Digital Industries also provides process control systems, machine-to-machine communication products, sensors (for measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) and radio frequency identification systems. Furthermore, Digital Industries offers production and product lifecycle management (PLM) software, and software for simulation and testing of mechatronic systems. These leading software offerings are supplemented by an electronic design automation (EDA) software portfolio; the Mendix cloud-native low-code application development platform, which allows customers to significantly reduce app development times through visual representation of underlying code; and digital marketplaces for the global electronics value chain, such as Supplyframe and Pixeom. Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and data-driven services.  Taken together, Digital Industries\u2019 offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development through production and post-sale services. With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in their evolution towards the \u201cDigital Enterprise,\u201d resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to market for new products. The most important customer markets include the automotive industry, the machine-building industry, the pharmaceutical and chemicals industry, the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry. Digital Industries serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in Digital Industries\u2019 profitability. Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for EDA, may also result in strong fluctuations in quarterly volume and profitability. In fiscal 2023, Digital Industries continued to transition parts of its software business, particularly PLM, from largely upfront revenue recognition towards Software as a Service (SaaS), which yields more predictable recurring revenue and offers growth opportunities by opening access to new customers, especially small and medium-sized companies seeking to reduce costs associated with owning complex IT infrastructure. The transition held back revenue growth rates and profit margin development in the software business in fiscal 2023 and Digital Industries expects continued impacts until completion of the transition. Competition with Digital Industries\u2019 business activities comes primarily from multinational corporations that offer a relatively broad portfolio and from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.   Digital Industries sees three trends influencing its business and providing long-term growth opportunities. Producers of investment goods in today\u2019s increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity, particularly to increase production flexibility and reduce time to market. This environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  7  offerings, which their customers either need or want in order to take full advantage of the investment goods. Finally, there is a trend from globalization to regionalization, to support local economic development, to increase supply chain resilience or to better adapt solutions to local needs. This is increasingly accompanied by more differentiated regulatory requirements.  Research & Development (R&D) activities at Digital Industries are aimed at innovative ways to merge the real and digital worlds with a continuous flow of data, so that customers can improve their products, production and resource efficiency. Digital Industries\u2019 innovations incorporate artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, SaaS and software-defined control, among other advanced technologies. As part of Siemens\u2019 open digital marketplace Siemens Xcelerator \u2013 a business platform that includes a curated portfolio of internet-of-things-enabled hardware, software and digital services from across Siemens and certified third parties and facilitates interactions and transactions between customers, partners and developers \u2013 Digital Industries in fiscal 2023 introduced Industrial Operations X, an open and interoperable portfolio for automating and operating industrial production. Industrial Operations X focuses on integrating IT capabilities such as AI, low-code programming, edge computing, and cloud computing with automation technology and digital services. Through various collaborations, Digital Industries is developing industrial-grade AI solutions. With Intrinsic, an Alphabet company, Digital Industries collaborates to accelerate the integration of AI-based robotics and automation technology. Digital Industries and Microsoft are harnessing generative AI to help industrial companies drive innovation and efficiency across the entire product lifecycle. Also in fiscal 2023, Digital Industries introduced several innovations based on cloud and edge technologies such as Simcenter Cloud HPC, which provides instant-on, rapidly scalable cloud-based high performance computing for complex simulation studies, hosted on Amazon Web Services; and Industrial Edge Management System for Kubernetes clusters, which addresses IT users in production and aims to save IT resources, energy, and costs. Major investments of Digital Industries in fiscal 2023 relate to its own factory automation, motion control and process automation businesses, to further automate and digitalize facilities particularly in Germany, China and Singapore.         Fiscal year % Change  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022 Actual Comp.  Orders 20,620 25,283 (18)% (17)%  Revenue 21,919 19,517 12% 15%  therein: software business  5,067 4,691 8% 10%  Profit 4,947 3,892 27%   Profit margin 22.6% 19.9%       Following extraordinary demand in fiscal 2022, which included proactive customer purchasing, orders at Digital Industries came in lower in its automation businesses. The short-cycle factory automation and the motion control businesses were affected most strongly due particularly to destocking at customers. These declines were partly offset by significant growth in the software business, due to large contract wins in both the PLM and the EDA businesses. Revenue rose on increases in all businesses due in part to conversion from the order backlog which had expanded significantly in the previous fiscal year. The strongest revenue growth contributions came from the factory automation and the process automation businesses. Overall, growth in the automation businesses was supported by improved availability of components year-over-year. Revenue growth in the software business was led by the EDA business while year-over-year growth in PLM was held back by the transition to SaaS. On a geographic basis, orders remained stable in the Americas region, but came in lower in the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East and in the region Asia, Australia due mainly to weaker demand in China. Revenue grew in all regions with the strongest contribution coming from the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East. Profit and profitability at Digital Industries rose on strong improvements in all automation businesses, supported by higher capacity utilization and a more favorable business mix including improved availability of components for high-margin products. Profit in the software business declined due to increased expenses related to cloud-based activities including severance charges, which for Digital Industries overall rose to \u20ac109 million, up from \u20ac64 million in the prior year.   At the beginning of fiscal 2024, business activities in the areas of low-voltage and geared motors and motor spindles, previously part of Digital Industries\u2019 motion control business, were transferred to Portfolio Companies. If the transfer to Portfolio Companies had already existed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, Digital Industries would have posted orders of \u20ac19.387 billion, revenue of \u20ac20.636 billion, profit of \u20ac4.833 billion and a profit margin of 23.4%. At the beginning of fiscal 2024, Digital Industries\u2019 order backlog amounted to \u20ac11 billion, of which \u20ac8 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.  In fiscal 2023, markets served by Digital Industries overall grew significantly. However, after a strong start, growth momentum increasingly slowed over the course of the fiscal year. This was particularly evident in China. On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to growth, led by the regions Americas and Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East. While global supply chain constraints eased, high price inflation led central banks to increase interest rates, which together with high energy costs impacted manufacturing industries. This impacted predominantly consumer- and building-related industries whereas production of investments goods still benefited from converting high order backlogs into current revenue. The entire manufacturing industry experienced a destocking of inventories as a countereffect of proactive ordering in the previous fiscal year. This was most evident in distributor channels and resulted in a significant decline in orders for automation equipment. Discrete industries, which are closer to consumer spending than process industries, were impacted earlier and more strongly than process industries, which are more project-based. The global automotive industry recovered throughout the year following a weak prior year, and benefited from improved supply chain conditions. Production of electric vehicles continued to increase. On a geographic basis, China, Japan, the U.S. and countries of the European Union saw a strong catchup of production mainly in the first half of the fiscal year. The machine-building industry grew strongly in the first half of fiscal 2023 but growth in major countries such as China, Germany, Japan and countries of the European Union came to a halt or market volume even declined in the second half of the fiscal year due to less favorable investment conditions caused by rising interest rates and a more cautious investment sentiment in consumer industries. Within the pharmaceutical and the chemicals industries, the pharmaceutical industry grew throughout the fiscal year, but with slower momentum towards the end of the fiscal year. In contrast, production in the chemicals industries declined in fiscal 2023. This was particularly evident within the countries of the European Union due mainly to high energy costs. The food and beverage industry grew strongly at the beginning of the fiscal year, driven by strong price increases. In the second half of the fiscal year, growth slowed considerably, reflecting weaker consumer spending. The market for electronics and semiconductors declined markedly at the beginning of fiscal 2023 but began to stabilize during the second half of the fiscal year. The decline, which was particularly evident in countries such as Taiwan and Korea with a focus on semiconductor production, was due among other factors to shrinking consumer"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  8  demand following unusually high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal 2024, markets served by Digital Industries are expected to grow markedly slower than in fiscal 2023. While industrial software markets are expected to grow clearly, short-cycle markets served by Digital Industries are expected to contract slightly. Among other factors, rebalancing of supply chains, trade conflicts, effects from geopolitical tensions, cautious consumer spending and downsizing of inventories, mainly in distribution channels, are expected to weigh on market growth.   3.3 Smart Infrastructure  Smart Infrastructure offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support the global transition from fossil to renewable energy sources, and the associated transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities.

Furthermore, Smart Infrastructure provides e-commerce platforms or marketplaces where customers can directly place orders on-line, either via a web shop or via electronic interfaces, and sells its broad range of digital offerings and connected devices via Siemens Xcelerator. These digital sales channels and e-commerce platforms are becoming increasingly important and Smart Infrastructure therefore is continuously strengthening its digital omni-channel marketing and e-commerce platforms.   Smart Infrastructure\u2019s principal competitors consist mainly of large multinational companies and smaller manufacturers in emerging countries. Its solutions and services business also competes with local players such as system integrators and facility management firms. Smart Infrastructure\u2019s businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment to varying degrees, depending on the customer segment and offering. Demand for Smart Infrastructure\u2019s electrical and building products offerings is driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, while demand for its systems and solutions offerings changes more slowly, with a time lag of several quarters. In contrast, demand for service offerings shows only limited influence from macroeconomic cycles. Overall, Smart Infrastructure has developed a balanced and resilient business mix with its diversified regional and vertical markets; its range of products, systems, solutions and services; and its participation in both long- and short-cycle markets. To further strengthen the resilience of its portfolio, Smart Infrastructure aims to increase the share of overall revenue that comes from services.  Smart Infrastructure benefits from a number of major trends. These include urbanization, demographic change, decarbonization, and digitalization. Urbanization and demographic change drive a need for smarter and more human-centric buildings. Climate change drives the need for decarbonization and digitalization. This results in an increasing demand for flexible and resilient energy infrastructures including rapid growth in electric mobility and more sustainable buildings. Digitalization is an enabler for such changes in both buildings and grids, making it possible to develop smarter buildings and manage electricity distribution with a higher share of renewables. The markets served are experiencing shifts that present opportunities where building technologies and electrification meet.  Smart Infrastructure\u2019s R&D activities focus on sustainable and decarbonizing offerings for buildings, utilities and industrial customers. Smart Infrastructure develops digital offerings for stable operation of electrical grids with a high share of renewable energy. In this regard, data from field devices is the basis for intelligent grid control and protection, providing grid flexibility and continuously matching energy supply and demand while protecting grid assets. Furthermore, it develops technologies for environmentally friendly and increasingly renewable-based energy systems, ranging from climate-friendly F-gas-free switchgear for medium voltage to charging solutions for e-mobility and grid integration of green hydrogen production. R&D efforts also strengthen Smart Infrastructure\u2019s capabilities to improve the sustainability, performance and attractiveness of buildings. Smart Infrastructure is expanding its digital offerings such as cloud solutions using field data from controllers and IoT devices and the business platform Building X on the principles of openness and modularity of Siemens Xcelerator. These and other offerings are enhanced using AI and large language models.

Orders increased clearly compared to the high prior-year level, which included proactive purchasing by customers. Growth was mainly driven by the electrification business and included a number of larger contract wins from data center, semiconductor, power distribution and battery manufacturing customers. Revenue rose in all businesses, with the strongest growth contributions coming from the electrification and the electrical products businesses. On a geographic basis, orders and revenue rose in all three reporting regions. The strongest growth contribution came from the Americas region, driven by the U.S., while growth in the Asia, Australia region was held back by declines in China, which were due mainly to negative currency translation effects. Profit also rose in all businesses. Growth in profit and profitability was driven by the electrical products and the electrification businesses due to higher revenue, by increased capacity utilization and by cost reductions achieved through the execution of Smart Infrastructure\u2019s competitiveness program. Severance charges were \u20ac50 million, up from \u20ac28 million a year earlier. At the end of fiscal 2023, Smart Infrastructure\u2019s order backlog was \u20ac16 billion, of which \u20ac10 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.  Overall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal 2023. Market dynamics were influenced by a further recovery from COVID-19-related effects; easing of supply chain and logistics constraints, which resulted in shorter lead times for order fulfillment; strong price inflation; and effects from the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, rising interest rates burdened building construction markets. On a geographic basis, all reporting regions contributed to growth. Price inflation affected all regions and was particularly high in the U.S. While on the one hand rising interest rates impacted growth in the U.S., economic activity was boosted by stimulus programs on the other hand. In China, the recovery from lockdown measures was significantly weaker than expected, which also impacted growth dynamics in other countries, while Europe was most strongly affected by the war in Ukraine and high energy prices. Grid markets grew clearly, driven by demand for integration of energy from renewable resources. Industrial markets also grew clearly on strong demand in the battery, semiconductor, and automotive industries. The buildings market overall also grew but activity in the commercial building market rose only moderately. In fiscal 2024, markets served by Smart Infrastructure are expected to grow clearly but at a slower pace than in fiscal 2023 due to a substantially lower effect from price inflation and a cooling of the general economic environment. While growth is expected to be weak in residential and commercial building markets and in some industrial markets, continued robust demand is expected for data centers and power distribution. Overall, market development in fiscal 2024 is expected to continue to be influenced by rebalancing of supply chains, trade conflicts and effects from geopolitical tensions.  3.4 Mobility  Mobility combines all Siemens businesses in the area of rail passenger and rail freight transportation. Within its rolling stock business, its offerings encompass vehicles and selected components for urban and regional transport such as metro systems, trams and light rail, and commuter trains as well as trains and passenger coaches for intercity and long-distance services, such as high-speed rail. Rolling stock offerings furthermore include locomotives and solutions for automated transportation such as automated people movers. Offerings in its rail infrastructure business include products and solutions for rail automation, such as automatic train control systems, interlocking, operations control and telematic systems, digital station solutions and railway communication systems, signaling on-board and signaling crossing products and yard and depot solutions; and for electrification such as AC and DC traction power supply, contact lines and network control. With its service business, Mobility provides maintenance and digital services, among others, for rolling stock and rail infrastructure throughout the entire lifecycle. In its turnkey business, it bundles consulting, planning, financing, construction, service and operation of complete mobility systems. Mobility\u2019s software business comprises train planning systems, trip planning, mobile ticketing, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) platforms, on-demand transportation and fleet management, data analytics, and inventory and reservation management.  Mobility sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales and execution units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and state-owned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. Customers usually have multi-year planning and implementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short-term economic trends. Large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded together with service contracts, which start to generate revenue only after the respective products and solutions have been put in operation, which can be a number of years after the contract award. Mobility\u2019s principal competitors are multinational companies. Consolidation among Mobility\u2019s competitors is continuing and may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail transport industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.  The main trends driving Mobility\u2019s markets are urbanization, decarbonization and digitalization. Increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable. At the same time, cities and national economies face the challenge of cutting CO2 and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation. The pressure on mobility providers to meet all these needs is expected to rise continuously. Furthermore, improving availability, connectivity, and sustainability of rail infrastructures increasingly requires digital solutions, which generates growth opportunities for providers of such solutions. IoT systems and new software-based solutions such as MaaS are expected to become major growth enablers for the rail industry. Overall trends towards urbanization, decarbonization and digitalization persist and many countries have been allocating significant funds to rail and public transport operators to address these trends.   Mobility\u2019s R&D strategy is focused on reducing life-cycle costs of rail infrastructure and rolling stock, securing system availability, increasing network capacity of rail infrastructure, optimizing the processes of rail operators and improving passenger experience. With Siemens Xcelerator, Mobility intends to make software more modular and increasingly move it to the cloud. At the same time, Mobility intends to enhance connectivity of hardware and software and provide open application programming interfaces. Thereby Mobility accelerates the pace and impact of digital innovation, which in turn benefits owners, operators, and customers of rail transport. Mobility\u2019s major R&D areas include the development of efficient vehicle platforms with optimized lifecycle cost; eco-friendly, alternative power supplies for trains; the Railigent X open application suite for maintenance of rail assets; smart connected products; the Distributed Smart Safe System (DS3), which allows for hardware-independent and cloud-enabled signaling; automatic train operation for European Train Control System (ETCS); safe artificial intelligence for driverless trains; air-free brake systems, 5G for wireless-based activities; the Mobility Software Suite X for operators and passengers; and cyber security. Mobility\u2019s investments focus mainly on maintaining or enhancing its production facilities, on meeting project demands, and on enhancing its depot services."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  10         Fiscal year % Change  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022 Actual Comp.

Contract wins in fiscal 2023 were highlighted by an order worth \u20ac2.9 billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in India, a \u20ac2.5 billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in Egypt and a \u20ac2.1 billion order for suburban trains in Germany. Order intake a year earlier included among others an order worth \u20ac1.5 billion for high-speed trains in Germany. Revenue rose on growth in nearly all businesses with the strongest contribution coming from the rolling stock business, and was supported by improved availability of components. On a geographic basis, revenue grew in all three reporting regions. Nominal volume development was held back by the fiscal 2022 divestment of Yunex Traffic, resulting in a portfolio effect which took four percentage points from order growth and five percentage points from revenue growth in the current period. As with revenue, profit and profitability rose in nearly all businesses. Profit in fiscal 2023 included a positive \u20ac0.2 billion in trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in Russia a year earlier, which burdened prior-year profit by \u20ac0.6 billion in impairments and other charges. In addition, profit in fiscal 2022 included impacts from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects. These burdens were largely offset by a gain of \u20ac0.7 billion from the sale of Yunex Traffic. Severance charges were \u20ac25 million, compared to \u20ac27 million a year earlier. Mobility\u2019s order backlog rose to \u20ac45 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.  Markets served by Mobility grew significantly in fiscal 2023, supported by long-term trends such as urbanization, decarbonization and increasing demand for digital solutions. Market dynamics in fiscal 2023 also benefited from receding material shortages and easing of supply chain constraints. On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to market growth, highlighted by large and very large orders in Germany, the U.S., Egypt and India, among others. The market for rolling stock included large orders for high-speed trains, commuter trains and locomotives in Europe, India and Egypt. Growth in North America included major investments in new and existing fleets, especially for urban transport. Growth in the rail infrastructure market was driven mainly by digitalization, deployment of ETCS technology and track electrification, for example with projects in Europe and Asia. For fiscal 2024, markets served by Mobility are expected to grow clearly, benefiting from the above-mentioned trends and with all reporting regions contributing to growth. Market expansion is expected to be supported by a large number of public investment programs. Mobility anticipates that rail operators in Europe, particularly in Germany and in the U.K., will continue making significant investments in rolling stock and advanced rail infrastructure solutions and that customers in the Middle East and Africa will tender large turnkey projects, especially in North Africa and the Middle East such as in in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Markets in the U.S. are expected to remain strong, especially due to ongoing investments in rolling stock, particularly for mainline and light rail transport; within the infrastructure market demand is expected to continue for mass transit including communications-based train control technology and from a developing market for rail freight solutions. In Asia, markets in India are expected to grow strongly with investments in mainline transport (high-speed trains, freight infrastructure, rolling stock fleet renewals and expansions of large commuter rail and locomotive tenders), urban metros and rail electrification driving growth.   3.5 Siemens Healthineers  Siemens as majority shareholder holds just over 75% of the shares of the publicly listed Siemens Healthineers AG, Germany. Siemens Healthineers is a global provider of healthcare products, solutions and services. It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers. In addition, Siemens Healthineers also provides clinical consulting services, as well as an extensive range of training and service offerings. This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along the entire care continuum, from prevention and early detection through to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care. The customer spectrum ranges from public and private healthcare providers, including hospitals and hospital systems, public and private clinics and laboratories, universities, physicians/joint medical practices, public health agencies, public and private health insurers, through to pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes. The imaging business provides imaging products, services, and solutions as well as digital offerings. Its most important products are devices for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, X-ray, molecular imaging, and ultrasound. The diagnostics business comprises in-vitro diagnostic products and services that are offered to healthcare providers in the fields of laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. The Varian business provides multi-modality cancer care technologies along with solutions and services to oncology departments in hospitals and clinics. The portfolio of the advanced therapies business consists of highly integrated products, services, and solutions across multiple clinical fields that are designed to support image-guided minimally invasive treatments, in areas such as cardiology, interventional radiology, and surgery. Competition in the imaging, Varian and advanced therapies businesses consists mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, while the diagnostics market is fragmented with a variety of global players that compete with each other across market segments and also with several regional players and specialized companies in niche technologies. Markets of Siemens Healthineers are characterized by long-term stability, though, over the long term, these markets may also experience shorter-term fluctuations arising from macroeconomic and health political developments, such as changes in health policy, regulation or reimbursement systems. Because a substantial portion of Siemens Healthineers\u2019 revenue stems from recurring business, growth opportunities can be pursued from a stable foundation of profit.   The addressable markets of Siemens Healthineers are shaped by four major trends. The first is demographic developments, in particular the growing and aging global population. This trend poses major challenges for global healthcare systems and, at the same time, offers an opportunity for healthcare providers as the demand for cost-efficient healthcare solutions increases. The second trend is economic development in emerging countries, which opens up improved access to healthcare for many people. Significant investment in the expansion of private and public healthcare systems will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and services and hence market growth. The third trend is the increase in non-communicable diseases as a consequence of an aging population and environmental and lifestyle-related changes. This trend results in far more patients with multiple morbidities, increasing the need for new ways to detect and treat diseases in a timely manner. The fourth global trend, the transformation of healthcare providers such as hospitals and"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  11  laboratories, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. This development is driven partly by staff shortages, society\u2019s increasing resistance to healthcare costs, the growing professionalization of health insurance and governmental healthcare systems, burdens from chronic diseases and the rapid scientific progress. The growing cost pressure will continue to drive new remuneration models for healthcare services such as value-based reimbursement instead of treatment-based reimbursement. As a result of these factors, there\u2019s a trend of consolidation of healthcare providers into networks. The aim of the resulting larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally and acting increasingly like large corporations are systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs. This development leads to an increased demand for standardized and scalable systems and solutions as well as new business models.  R&D activities at Siemens Healthineers are aimed at offering innovative and sustainable solutions for diagnostics and therapy to its customers. Artificial intelligence, sensors, and robotics are focal points of the R&D activities at Siemens Healthineers. A growing share of the R&D activities is devoted to improving the sustainability of the products. Furthermore, the systems of Siemens Healthineers regularly receive extensive software releases to improve user friendliness and add innovative applications. Investments at Siemens Healthineers were mainly for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities, in particular in the U.S. and China, for measures related to improving operational efficiency and for additions to intangible assets, including capitalized development expenses for products within the Atellica product line.         Fiscal year % Change  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022 Actual Comp.

While the imaging and Varian businesses in particular delivered growth in both orders and revenue, this was offset by a substantial decline in the diagnostics business. On a geographic basis, revenue was on the prior-year level in all regions; in the Asia, Australia region reported revenue was held back by negative currency translation effects. Profit declined primarily due to substantially lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests in the diagnostics business, which also recorded charges of \u20ac0.2 billion related to its transformation program. In addition, profitability was burdened by impairments and other charges totaling \u20ac0.3 billion due to a management decision to refocus certain activities in the advanced therapies business. The imaging and Varian businesses increased their profit contributions on higher revenue. Severance charges were \u20ac167 million in fiscal 2023, compared to \u20ac71 million a year earlier. The order backlog for Siemens Healthineers was \u20ac34 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.  In general, the addressable global markets of Siemens Healthineers excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests grew moderately in fiscal 2023. From a regional perspective, the Asia, Australia region saw market growth in most businesses; in China, government subsidy programs, among others, including the program of lending incentives associated with the economic stimulus package, had a positive effect on investment by healthcare providers. In the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, government subsidy programs, among others, were able to support growth in most businesses. In the U.S., market growth was recorded in all businesses. Globally, higher volume in the market for the imaging business was generated thanks to the high level of order backlogs resulting from demand catch-up effects, on the one hand, and investments in diagnostic imaging equipment in reaction to announced price hikes, on the other hand. The imaging market is expected to grow moderately overall in fiscal 2024, driven mainly by pent-up demand for the major imaging modalities. Within the diagnostics business, demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests declined sharply after the COVID-19 pandemic ceased to be a global health emergency and the incidence of COVID-19 infections subsided. The market for the diagnostics business is expected to achieve slight growth in fiscal 2024, excluding COVID-19 testing. In the market for Varian, overall market growth, especially in the U.S. and Western Europe, was boosted mainly by increasing demand for product innovations and services as well as by an intact replacement market. For this reason, the market for Varian is expected to grow clearly in fiscal 2024. For advanced therapies business, government subsidy programs, including lending incentives enacted as part of the economic stimulus package in China along with EU investment programs, positively influenced market development. The expectation for the advanced therapies business is that the market will continue to grow moderately in fiscal 2024. 3.6 Siemens Financial Services   Siemens Financial Services provides financing solutions for Siemens\u2019 customers as well as other companies in the form of debt and equity investments. Based on its comprehensive financing know-how and specialist technology expertise in the areas of Siemens businesses, SFS supports its customers\u2019 investments with leasing, lending, working capital and structured financing solutions and offers a broad range of equipment and project financing. In addition, SFS supports Siemens\u2019 industrial businesses with financial advisory services and via a joint go-to-market that includes SFS\u2019s risk management expertise, such as to assess the risk profiles of projects or business models. Furthermore, SFS collaborates with Siemens\u2019 industrial businesses to co-develop new digital business models, and also supports its customers through targeted financings in sustainable technologies and projects."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  12           Fiscal year  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022  Earnings before taxes (EBT) 563 498  therein: equity business 201 269  ROE (after taxes) 16.3% 15.6%       Sep 30, Sep 30,  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022  Total assets 32,915 33,263     Siemens Financial Services in fiscal 2023 recorded higher earnings before taxes in the debt business despite a volatile credit environment. In the prior period, earnings before taxes were burdened by \u20ac0.2 billion in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of the fiscal year. The equity business recorded strong results. While both periods under review included gains from the sales of equity investments, fiscal 2022 additionally included higher gains from fair value measurements of investments and gains from energy-related investments in connection with rising prices in global energy markets.  Net cash from operations (defined as the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities) amounted to \u20ac(733) million compared to \u20ac(616) million in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, net cash from operations comprised Free cash flow of \u20ac852 million and \u20ac985 million, respectively, while remaining cash flows from investing activities, including from changes in receivables from financing activities, comprised \u20ac(1,585) million and \u20ac(1,601) million, respectively.   Despite the increase in receivables from financing activities, total assets decreased since the end of fiscal 2022 due primarily to negative currency translation effects.     SFS\u2019s business scope and capital allocation is focused on areas of intense domain know-how closely aligned with Siemens\u2019 customers and markets, particularly for Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Mobility. Accordingly, SFS is influenced by the business development of the markets served by the industrial businesses, among other factors, including macroeconomic effects such as inflation or recession which could impact the credit risk of customers. In addition to its high level of diversification across industries, SFS has a strong regional footprint in investment-grade countries, with the highest share in the U.S. SFS intends to maintain a highly diversified portfolio across regions, while participating in the strong economic development of selected Asian markets. 3.7 Portfolio Companies  Portfolio Companies comprise businesses which deliver a broad range of customized and application-specific products, software, solutions, systems and services for different industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber. Unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal re-organization, digitalization, cost improvements, and optimizing procurement, production and service activities. After achieving certain threshold performance targets, businesses may be combined with another business in the same industry, sold, placed into an external private equity partnership, or exited via a public listing.   At the end of fiscal 2023, Portfolio Companies consisted mainly of three separately managed units: Large Drives Applications offers electric motors, converters and mining solutions. Siemens Logistics offers sorting technology and solutions focused on handling baggage and cargo in airports. Siemens Energy Assets comprises certain regional business activities of the former Gas and Power segment; as part of the Siemens Energy carve-out these activities remained so far with Siemens due to country-specific regulatory restrictions or economic considerations.   Demand within the industries served by Portfolio Companies mainly shows a delayed response to changes in the overall economic environment. Financial results are strongly dependent, however, on customer investment cycles in their key industries. In commodity-based industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. The heterogonous industrial customer base of the separately managed units requires a dedicated sales approach based on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requests, resulting in the use of various sales and marketing channels for Portfolio Companies.

While order growth was driven by higher volume from larger orders, most evidently at the Airport Logistics business of Siemens Logistics, revenue increased mainly at Large Drives Applications in part due to strong conversion of the order backlog. Primarily due to the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, portfolio effects took eleven and 13 percentage points from orders and revenue, respectively. The strong profit was driven by Siemens Energy Assets and Large Drives Applications. Additionally, Portfolio Companies recorded a gain of \u20ac0.1 billion from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business. For comparison, profit in fiscal 2022 included a gain of \u20ac1.1 billion from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and a revaluation gain of \u20ac0.3 billion in connection with the sale of the equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Portfolio Companies recorded lower severance charges of \u20ac12 million, down from \u20ac20 million in fiscal 2022."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  13  Although the broad range of businesses is operating in diverse markets, overall the main markets served by Portfolio Companies are generally impacted by uncertainties regarding geopolitical and economic developments which tend to trigger customer caution regarding purchasing decisions. After the post-pandemic recovery, a normalizing growth momentum is expected in most end-customer vertical markets in fiscal 2024.   At the beginning of fiscal 2024, Large Drives Applications and certain business activities which were transferred from Digital Industries are combined in the areas of low- to high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor spindles under a new separately managed unit, Innomotics. If the transfer from Digital Industries had already existed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, Portfolio Companies would have posted orders of \u20ac5,317 million, revenue of \u20ac4,699 million, profit of \u20ac457 million and a profit margin of 9.7%.

These gains were partly offset by Siemens\u2019 share of Siemens Energy\u2019s after-tax loss and expenses from amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation totaling \u20ac1.5 billion (fiscal 2022: totaling \u20ac0.2 billion).   Financing, eliminations and other items included a revaluation loss of \u20ac0.2 billion on the stake in Thoughtworks Holding Inc. (fiscal 2022: a loss of \u20ac0.3 billion). For comparison, fiscal 2022 included also impacts totaling \u20ac0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, resulting from the sale of Siemens\u2019 financing and leasing business in Russia, as well as a loss of \u20ac0.1 billion resulting from applying hyperinflation accounting. These effects were partly offset in fiscal 2022 by a gain of \u20ac0.5 billion in connection with an investment accounted for using the equity method mainly due to fair value measurement."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  14  4.

Severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac430 million, of which \u20ac351 million were in Industrial Business. In fiscal 2022, severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac272 million, of which \u20ac190 million were in Industrial Business.  The tax rate in fiscal 2023 was 24% (fiscal 2022: 38%), benefiting from tax-free gains in relation to the partial reversal of an impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. Moreover, the gain recorded in connection with the capital increase by Siemens Energy AG was also tax-free. These positive influences on the tax rate were partly offset by our participation in the after-tax loss at Siemens Energy, which was not tax-deductible. As a result, the increase in Income from continuing operations was 93%.  The increase in Basic EPS and in EPS pre PPA reflects the increase of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was \u20ac7,949 million in fiscal 2023 compared to \u20ac3,723 million in fiscal 2022, combined with a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding. Our investment in Siemens Energy AG contributed \u20ac0.84 to the increase of EPS pre PPA.  At 18.6%, ROCE was back in the target range established in our Siemens Financial Framework. The increase year-over-year was due primarily to sharply higher income before interest after tax. 4.3 Research and development  In fiscal 2023, we reported research and development expenses of \u20ac6.2 billion, compared to \u20ac5.6 billion in fiscal 2022. The resulting R&D intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, was 8.0% (fiscal 2022: 7.8%). Additions to capitalized development expenses amounted to \u20ac0.3 billion as in the prior year. As of September 30, 2023, Siemens worldwide held approximately 45,000 granted patents in its continuing operations. On average, we had 50,029 R&D employees in fiscal 2023.  Our research and development activities are ultimately geared to developing innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers \u2013 and our businesses \u2013 while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Joint implementation by the operating units and Technology, our central R&D department, ensures that research activities and business strategies are closely aligned with one another, and that all units benefit equally and quickly from technological developments.  Siemens\u2019 core technologies have been determined to be critical for our Company\u2019s long-term success and that of our customers. They are bundled in eleven technology areas: additive manufacturing and materials (from fiscal 2024 on: advanced manufacturing and circularity), cybersecurity and trust, data analytics and artificial intelligence, power electronics, simulation and digital twin, sustainable energy and infrastructure, future of automation, integrated circuits and electronics, connectivity and edge, software systems and processes, and user experience.  We advance technologies also through our open innovation concept. We work closely with scholars from leading universities, research institutions and academic start-ups, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects. Our focus here is on our strategic research partners and in particular the Siemens Research and Innovation Ecosystems, which we maintain at 16 locations worldwide.   Siemens\u2019 global venture capital unit, Next47, provides capital to help start-ups expand and scale. It serves as the creator of next-generation businesses for Siemens by building, buying and partnering with innovative companies at any stage. Next47 is focused on anticipating how emerging technologies will influence our end markets.

The increase in other current financial assets was driven mainly by higher loans receivable at SFS, which were mainly due to new business and reclassification of loans receivable from other financial assets due to a reassessment of the expected repayment dates. The latter was a major factor also for the decrease of other financial assets, along with decreased positive fair values of derivative financial instruments.  Inventories increased in all industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at Mobility and Siemens Healthineers.  The decrease of other intangible assets resulted mainly from negative currency translation effects and from impairments recorded at Siemens Healthineers.

This was partly offset by the repayment of euro, U.S. dollar and British pound instruments totaling \u20ac4.6 billion.   Long-term debt decreased due primarily to the above-mentioned reclassifications and currency translation effects of \u20ac1.9 billion on bonds issued in the U.S. dollar and British pound. Set against this were mainly increases of \u20ac2.5 billion from the issuance of euro bonds.   The contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. led to a decrease of provisions for pensions and similar obligations. Additional major effects resulted from returns on plan assets and actuarial gains and losses. For further information see Note 17 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for fiscal 2023.   The main factors for the decrease in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were a negative other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of \u20ac4.0 billion resulting mainly from currency translation; dividend payments of \u20ac3.4 billion (for fiscal 2022); and changes in equity totaling \u20ac1.6 billion resulting from an equity transaction at Siemens Energy AG. These factors were largely offset by \u20ac7.9 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby reducing issued capital by \u20ac150 million and retained earnings by \u20ac5.1 billion.   Capital structure ratio  Our capital structure ratio as of September 30, 2023 decreased to 0.6 from 1.0 a year earlier. The change was due to a decrease in Industrial net debt and a higher EBITDA.  Debt and credit facilities  As of September 30, 2023, we recorded, in total, \u20ac40.9 billion in notes and bonds, \u20ac2.2 billion in loans from banks, \u20ac0.5 billion in other financial indebtedness and \u20ac2.9 billion in lease liabilities.

Cash outflows for purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes included additions of assets eligible as central bank collateral and payments for debt or equity investments.  Cash outflows from change in receivables from financing activities of SFS related primarily to SFS\u2019s debt business.  Cash inflows from other disposals of assets included mainly proceeds from disposals of assets eligible as central bank collateral, from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business by Portfolio Companies, and from the sale or disposal of debt or equity investments.

Investing activities  Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment from continuing operations totaled \u20ac2.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Within the industrial businesses, ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations; maintaining, extending and digitalizing our capacities for designing, manufacturing and marketing new solutions; improving productivity; and replacements of fixed assets. These investments amounted to \u20ac1.7 billion in fiscal 2023. The remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate, including significant amounts for projects such as new office buildings in Germany and Spain. Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions.

In the context of the \u20ac2 billion investment strategy presented in fiscal 2023 to strengthen growth, innovation and resilience, significant amounts will be invested in the coming years for the construction and expansion of high-tech production facilities in the U.S., China and Singapore. As part of this investment strategy, Siemens also announced the establishment of its new Technology Campus in Erlangen, Germany, to expand development and manufacturing capacities. In addition, up to \u20ac0.6 billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square. This project, initiated in fiscal 2019, aims to transform Siemens\u2019 existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key technologies.

Furthermore, we continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next47, our global venture capital unit."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  20  7. Overall assessment of the economic position  Overall, global economic development in fiscal 2023 was mixed and characterized by a number of headwinds. In this environment, Siemens delivered a very strong performance in all its businesses due to its strategic positioning relative to long-term trends such as automation, electrification and digitalization. With our offerings, we help increase resource efficiency and the decarbonization of industry, transport and building infrastructures and make manufacturing more resilient and flexible. We expect these trends to continue to drive our growth in the coming years.  During fiscal 2023, we made further progress in focusing our business portfolio by selling our Commercial Vehicles business. Furthermore, we began forming a new motors and large drives company under the name Innomotics by combining our existing business activities in the areas of low- to high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor spindles. Also, we further reduced our stake in Siemens Energy AG to 25.1% and transferred shares to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. To boost future growth and drive innovation, we announced a \u20ac2 billion investment strategy mainly for new manufacturing capacity as well as innovation labs and education centers. We also expanded our open digital business platform, Siemens Xcelerator, by introducing Industrial Operations X, which includes a broad range of interoperable offerings for more adaptive production, and by adding new cloud-based applications for Building X, our suite for smart and sustainable buildings.  Fiscal 2023 was another very successful year for Siemens. We achieved excellent financial results in a volatile market environment, which on the one hand included destocking by customers and distributors following previously proactive purchasing, particularly in our short-cycle businesses, and on the other hand included improved supply chain conditions, which accelerated revenue conversion from our high order backlog. We raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the first and the second quarters. We then reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2023. We achieved revenue growth of 11% net of currency translation and portfolio effects and delivered EPS pre PPA of \u20ac10.77. Excluding Siemens Energy Investment, EPS pre PPA was \u20ac9.93. ROCE increased to 18.6%, our capital structure ratio came in at 0.6, and the cash conversion rate was 1.17.  Orders rose 7% year-over-year to \u20ac92.3 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.19, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above 1. Order growth was driven by sharply higher volume from large orders at Mobility, including an order worth \u20ac2.9 billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in India and a \u20ac2.5 billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in Egypt, and by clear growth in Smart Infrastructure led by the electrification business. Orders in Digital Industries came in lower as the destocking trend mentioned above had a significant effect on its automation businesses.  Revenue was higher in nearly all our industrial businesses and rose to \u20ac77.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries contributed double-digit growth with all businesses posting increases. Revenue growth at Smart Infrastructure was led by the electrification and the electrical products businesses, while at Digital Industries the factory automation and the process automation businesses contributed the strongest growth. Revenue growth at Mobility was led by a significant increase in the rolling stock business. Revenue at Siemens Healthineers remained on the prior-year level as growth particularly in the imaging and Varian businesses was offset by a decline in the diagnostics business. Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens rose 11%. We thus exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2022, which was to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9%, and reached the upper end of our subsequently raised outlook, which was to achieve 9% to 11% in comparable revenue growth.  Profit Industrial Business exceeded the record high of a year earlier and rose 11% to \u20ac11.4 billion. All industrial businesses except Siemens Healthineers increased their profit year-over-year. The strongest increase came from Smart Infrastructure on improvements in all its businesses, led by the electrical products and the electrification businesses. Growth at Digital Industries was driven by the automation businesses, only partly offset by a decline in profit in the software business due mainly to higher expenses related to cloud-based activities. Profit at Mobility increased in nearly all businesses and included positive trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in Russia a year earlier. Profit at Siemens Healthineers came in lower on declines in the diagnostics business, due primarily to sharply lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests as well as charges related to its transformation program and charges related to refocusing certain activities in the advanced therapies business.  The profit margin of our Industrial Business rose to 15.4%, up from 15.1% a year earlier, reaching its highest level ever. Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure achieved the strongest increases and also contributed the highest margins: 22.6% and 15.4%, respectively. The profit margin for Mobility rose slightly to 8.4%, while the profit margin at Siemens Healthineers declined to 11.7%.   Earnings before taxes at SFS increased significantly due mainly to higher earnings before taxes in the debt business, which in the prior fiscal year included a \u20ac0.2 billion impact in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia. Return on equity after tax for SFS increased to 16.3%. Profit at Portfolio Companies included a \u20ac0.1 billion gain from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business but came in sharply lower compared to the prior fiscal year which had included a \u20ac1.1 billion gain from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and a \u20ac0.3 billion revaluation gain in connection with the sale of our stake in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Results within Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements benefited from positive effects related to Siemens Energy Investment, including \u20ac1.6 billion from a partial reversal of the prior-year \u20ac2.7 billion impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG. These positive effects were partly offset by Siemens\u2019 share of Siemens Energy\u2019s after-tax loss.   Net income nearly doubled year-over-year to a historic high of \u20ac8.5 billion and corresponding basic EPS more than doubled to \u20ac10.04. EPS pre PPA increased to \u20ac10.77. Excluding a positive \u20ac0.84 per share related to Siemens Energy Investment, EPS pre PPA was \u20ac9.93. We thus exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2022, which was to achieve EPS pre PPA in a range of \u20ac8.70 to \u20ac9.20, and exceeded our forecast made after the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which was for EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment in the range of \u20ac9.60 to \u20ac9.90.  ROCE for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022. This increase was due to sharply higher income before interest after tax year-over-year. We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE provided in our Combined Management Report 2022, which was to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.  We evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA. Due to a combination of a decrease in Industrial net debt and higher EBITDA year-over-year, this ratio declined to 0.6. We thus achieved the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report 2022, which was to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  21  Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 was \u20ac10.0 billion, reaching a record high.

We thus achieved a cash conversion rate that contributed strongly to the average required to reach our target of 1 minus annual comparable revenue growth rate over a cycle of three to five years.  We intend to continue providing an attractive shareholder return. The Siemens Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, proposes a dividend of \u20ac4.70 per share, up from \u20ac4.25 per share a year earlier."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  22  8. Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks  8.1 Report on expected developments  8.1.1 Worldwide economy  The global economy showed remarkable resilience in calendar 2023, given the number of headwinds and negative economic shocks from the previous year. Nevertheless, these shocks still have adverse implications for economic growth in calendar 2024, especially the dampening effects of tighter financial conditions. Accordingly, in calendar 2024 the global economy is expected to further slow down to 2.3% GDP growth, after 2.6% in calendar 2023. Given the high number of active and potential geopolitical conflicts, the outlook is subject to a high level of uncertainty.  In the E.U., GDP is expected to increase by 0.8% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 0.4% in calendar 2023. The effects of the energy crisis still show negative impacts, especially in energy-intensive industries. Tighter monetary policy \u2013 the European Central Bank lifted the main policy interest rate to 4.5% in just over one year \u2013 also held back growth, particularly in the construction industry. The German economy is most impacted due to its proportionally large manufacturing sector and is expected to grow by only 0.5% in calendar 2024.   The U.S. economy is expected to decelerate to a soft landing. After unexpectedly strong GDP growth (expected to be +2.5%) in calendar 2023, caused mainly by a very strong services sector while industry was weak, growth in calendar 2024 is expected to slow down to 1.6%. Tighter financial conditions \u2013 the Federal Reserve increased the main policy interest rate to 5.5% and longer-term interest rates also increased substantially \u2013 will unfold their full effect next year. Hence, a short and shallow recession during calendar 2024, while not our baseline assumption, is also possible and expected by some economists. Consumer spending is expected to continue as a primary growth driver, while government investment programs (CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act) play a supporting role for the economy as they spur business investment.   GDP in China is expected to grow at only 4.6% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 5.0% in calendar 2023. The correction in the real estate sector will continue to weigh on GDP growth. During calendar 2024 global goods demand, world trade and industrial production are expected to modestly increase again. The main assumption behind this expectation is further normalization for two critical factors: consumer spending and the inventory policies of companies. Both weighed on industrial output in calendar 2023 but are expected to modestly support growth of the Chinese economy in calendar 2024. In addition, Chinese private consumption is expected to drive domestic demand and some tailwinds will come from announced stimulus measures.   Globally, the decline of inflation rates is expected to continue, although at a slower pace. Past interest rate hikes are having the desired effect, and headline inflation is expected to steadily approach the central bank targets. Hence, monetary policy is expected to become less restrictive in calendar 2024.  Global fixed investments should benefit from government programs and from factory investments to improve supply chain resilience and other diversification measures. Global gross fixed investments are expected to grow by 3.2% in calendar 2024, unchanged from 3.2% in the year before.  Given the forecasted further slowdown of the global economy, growth of markets served by Siemens is also expected to slow in fiscal 2024 in light of significant headwinds, few tailwinds, and reduced stabilizing effects from high industry\u2019s order backlogs and price adjustments in a number of our businesses.   The forecasts for calendars 2024 and 2023 presented here for GDP and fixed investments are based on a report from S&P Global dated October 15, 2023.  8.1.2 Siemens Group  We are basing our outlook for fiscal 2024 on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation and also on the specific market conditions we expect for our respective industrial businesses, as described in chapter 3 Segment information. Furthermore, we assume that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. We expect improvements in productivity and adjusting prices for our own products, solutions and services to more than offset effects from wage increases and higher prices for raw materials and components.  We are exposed to currency translation effects, mainly involving the U.S. dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, particularly the Chinese yuan. Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal 2024, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. In addition to the natural hedging strategy, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal 2024. In this outlook, we assume that currency translation effects in fiscal 2024 slightly reduce nominal volume growth rates for Siemens and profitability of our businesses.  This outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.  Segments  Digital Industries expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue development of 0% to 3%. This is based on the assumption that following destocking by customers, global demand in the automation businesses, especially in China, will pick up again in the second half of the fiscal year. The profit margin is expected to be 20% to 23%.  Smart Infrastructure expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue growth of 7% to 10%. The profit margin is expected to be 15% to 17%.   Mobility expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue growth of 8% to 11%. The profit margin is expected to be 8% to 10%."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  23  Siemens Healthineers expects to achieve comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5% in fiscal 2024, and to contribute solidly to the profit and profit margin of our Industrial Business.  SFS anticipates further gradually improved earnings before taxes in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Return on equity (ROE) (after tax) is expected to be in the target range of 15% to 20%.  Revenue growth  For comparable revenue, we expect the Siemens Group to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8%. Furthermore, we anticipate that orders in fiscal 2024 will exceed revenue for a book-to-bill ratio above 1.  As of September 30, 2023, our order backlog totaled \u20ac111 billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue growth in fiscal 2024 with approximately \u20ac43 billion of past orders converted to current revenue. For expected conversion of order backlog to revenue for our respective segments, see chapter 3 Segment information.  Profitability  Outside our reportable segments, we expect Portfolio Companies to achieve an operational margin of more than 5%.   Results of Siemens Energy Investment depend on the performance of Siemens Energy and are excluded from our forecast for EPS pre PPA. We anticipate that Siemens Real Estate will continue with real estate disposals depending on market conditions. Results for Innovation are expected on the prior-year level, which was a negative \u20ac0.2 billion. The negative results related to Governance declined to \u20ac0.5 billion in fiscal 2023; we expect a further improvement in fiscal 2024. Centrally carried pension expense are expected to be on the prior-year level, which was a negative \u20ac0.1 billion. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is expected in a range of \u20ac0.7 billion to \u20ac0.8 billion in fiscal 2024 based on our current business portfolio. Financing, eliminations and other items, which were a negative \u20ac0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, are expected to be on the prior-year level depending on market developments.   We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of 24% to 29%. This assumption does not take into consideration possible impacts from potential major tax reforms.   Our forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors. We assume solid project execution continues in fiscal 2024. We plan to keep the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, which was 8% in fiscal 2023 at approximately the level in fiscal 2024. We expect the ratio of selling and general administrative expenses to revenue, which was 18% in fiscal 2023 to remain approximately on this level in fiscal 2024. Severance charges, which were \u20ac0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, are expected at a lower level in fiscal 2024.  Given the above-mentioned assumptions, we expect profitable growth of our Industrial Business to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment to a range of \u20ac10.40 to \u20ac11.00 in fiscal 2024, along with a corresponding increase in net income. For comparison, fiscal 2023 EPS pre PPA was \u20ac9.93 excluding \u20ac0.84 in EPS pre PPA from Siemens Energy Investment.  Capital efficiency  For fiscal 2024, we expect ROCE to be in our target range of 15% to 20%.  Capital structure  We aim in general for a capital structure of up to 1.5; we expect to achieve this in fiscal 2024.  Cash conversion rate  For fiscal 2024, we expect a cash conversion rate that contributes to reaching our target of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of Siemens over a cycle of three to five years.  8.1.3 Overall assessment  Our outlook for the Siemens Group for fiscal 2024 is based on the assumption that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. Under this condition, we expect our Industrial Business to continue its profitable growth.  For the Siemens Group we expect comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8% and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.  We expect profitable growth of our Industrial Business to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment to a range of \u20ac10.40 to \u20ac11.00 in fiscal 2024, up from EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment of \u20ac9.93 in fiscal 2023.  This outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.  Overall, the actual development for Siemens and its segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to the risks and opportunities described below or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize. 8.2 Risk management   8.2.1 Basic principles of risk management  Our risk management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. Our organizational and accountability structure requires each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  24  8.2.2 Enterprise risk management process  We have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. The most important of these systems include our enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks and opportunities well in advance of major business decisions, while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our risk management and its contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. Accordingly, if deficits are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate measures for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.  Risk management at Siemens builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process, our internal control and our compliance management system. They consider a company\u2019s strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.  Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e.g. as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity\u2019s business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risks arising from the same cause (e.g. deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective managements of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above.  Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to \u201cpursue\u201d the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses. Among others, we address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary. Due to regular screening of climate risks and environmental, social and governance (ESG) developments we can initiate related mitigation actions in a timely manner \u2013 also as part of our DEGREE implementation. Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic or other infectious developments such as bioterrorism to cause high disease rates in countries, regions or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and Europe, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as early as possible.  8.2.3 Risk management organization and responsibilities   To oversee the ERM process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Managing Board established a Risk Management and Internal Control Organization, led by the Head of Assurance. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. This aggregation naturally results in a mixture of risks, including those with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative assessment; the same applies to opportunities. Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk and opportunity themes. Thematic risk and opportunity assessments as well as our risk-bearing capacity then form the basis for the evaluation of the company-wide risk and opportunity situation during the quarterly Managing Board meetings. The Head of Assurance assists the Managing Board with the operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  25  8.3 Risks  Below we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation. The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risks\u2019 current importance to us. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations. Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units.  8.3.1 Strategic risks  Economic, political and geopolitical conditions: We see high uncertainties regarding the global economic and geopolitical outlook, which deteriorated significantly in the past year due to multiple headwinds, all of which may continue to intensify. First, the Israel-Gaza conflict continues to escalate and might cause a larger regional conflict involving further parties. Ongoing risks emanate from the war in Ukraine. Both the Israel-Gaza conflict and the war in Ukraine may have negative impacts on sales development, production processes and purchasing and logistics processes, for example through interruptions in supply chains and energy supplies or bottlenecks affecting components, raw materials and intermediate products. Each of the conflicts could also intensify further to the point of expanding to include other warring parties, including NATO countries, and the use of unconventional weapons. An expansion of the conflicts would have a significant impact on the Siemens market environment. Even the current states of conflicts could have a further negative impact on development of potential crude oil and natural gas supplies. This would fuel inflation, with further risk of a sustained wage-price-spiral. In any case one of the core risks for the Siemens outlook is that central banks may fail to get inflation below their targets and then react more restrictively or even overreact. More restrictive financial conditions would likely push advanced economies into recession and pose a significant risk to vulnerable emerging economies. Highly indebted (emerging and industrialized) countries could suffer from increasing financing costs, further U.S. dollar appreciation, and loss of investor confidence. Other risks could arise for the stability of public finances and the banking sector. Further risks are coming from other geopolitical tensions (particularly associated with the Baltics, Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, China, Taiwan, and Iran). We continue to face economic risks from a further significant slow-down of the Chinese economy. Key risks are coming from potential financial imbalances, particularly due to the struggling real-estate sector, but also from the growing debt-level of local governments, with growing negative implications for Siemens business in China and the country\u2019s trading partners. Obstruction and redefinitions of international cooperation agreements could severely impact our business. First and foremost a more extensive U.S.-China decoupling would have adverse effects on confidence and investment activity and would severely hit Siemens\u2019 business. Increasing trade barriers, protectionism, sanctions and in particular technical regulations would negatively impact production costs and productivity along our global value chains, as well as significantly impede or even hinder access to sales markets. A significant risk to our sales potential and cost structures is coming from the possibility of renewed supply chain bottlenecks, due to growing lack of availability of intermediate goods, in particular electronic components. Furthermore, grid-lock in U.S. politics could weigh on U.S. growth with the risk of a global spillover. We are dependent on the economic development of certain industries; a continuation or even an intensification of the cyclical and structural headwinds in core customer industries, e.g. automotive or construction, would have adverse impact on our business prospects. A resurgence of COVID-19 or even the outbreak of a new pandemic, a terrorist attack, a significant cybercrime incident, or a series of such attacks or incidents in major economies, could depress economic activity globally and undermine consumer and business confidence. Additionally, the highly interconnected global economy remains vulnerable to natural disasters or hybrid warfare.  If we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects. For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed. In addition, it may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing. Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance payments by our customers relating to long-term projects, may become less favorable, which could negatively impact our financial condition. Siemens\u2019 global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e.g. equipment, components, systems, software, services and solutions) help us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market.  Portfolio measures, at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances: Our strategy includes divesting our activities in some business areas and strengthening others through portfolio measures, including mergers and acquisitions. With respect to divestments, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. There can be no assurance that any of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and in a timely manner as originally planned, or that they will perform as anticipated once integrated. In addition, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses. Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needs and adversely affect our capital structure. Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to intangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. If we were to encounter continuing adverse business developments or if we were otherwise to perform worse than expected at acquisition activities, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, might have to be impaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. Our investment portfolio includes investments held for purposes other than trading and other investments. Any factors negatively influencing the financial condition and results of operations of our at-equity investments, such as Siemens Energy, and other investments could have an adverse effect on our equity pick-up related to these investments or may result in a related write-off. In addition, our business situation, financial condition and results of operations could also be adversely affected in connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to these investments. Furthermore, such investments are inherently risky as we may not be able to sufficiently influence corporate governance processes or business decisions taken by our at-equity investments, by other investments and by strategic alliances, which may have a negative effect on our business and especially on our reputation. In addition, joint ventures bear the risk of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. Strategic alliances may also pose risks for us because we compete in some business areas with companies with which we have strategic alliances. Besides other measures, we handle these risks with standardized processes as well as dedicated roles and responsibilities in the areas of mergers, acquisitions, divestments and carve-outs. This includes the systematic treatment of all contractual obligations and post-closing claims."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  26  Increasing sustainability focus: Governments around the world continue to increase their focus on sustainability topics, resulting in the risk of increased costs to comply with new laws and related reporting requirements. In addition, increasing stakeholder and investor focus on sustainability topics brings reputational risk should our sustainability commitments, targets and activities be perceived as a deceptive use of green marketing or otherwise not credible. Climate change litigation has become a worldwide phenomenon with a corresponding risk to Siemens as a large corporation. We address these risks in a variety of ways including through our sustainability framework DEGREE, in which we have set ambitious sustainability targets. DEGREE includes measures to reduce our carbon footprint along with other initiatives addressing ESG topics more generally. We have implemented an ESG due diligence process that supports Siemens businesses with due diligence in the customer-oriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and reputational risks. Finally, we believe our overall portfolio is very well positioned to meet the current and future sustainability needs of our customers and the societies in which we operate.  Disruptive technologies: The markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. In the field of digitalization (e.g. Digital Twin, artificial intelligence, cloud computing), there are risks associated with new competitors, substitutions for existing products/solutions/services, new business models (e.g. in terms of pricing, financing, extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business), and finally the risk that our competitors may have more advanced time-to-market strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than Siemens. Siemens generally differentiates its software offerings from those of other software companies through deep domain know-how. There are risks associated with technologies such as artificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence, that domain expertise will not be a significant distinguishing feature in the future, and that additional competitors may therefore emerge more easily or rapidly. Our operating results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets, and our ability to optimize our cost base accordingly. Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success. Our results of operations may suffer if we invest in technologies that do not operate or may not be integrated as expected, or that are not accepted in the marketplace as anticipated, or if our products, solutions or systems are not introduced to the market in a timely manner, particularly compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete. We constantly apply for new patents and actively manage our intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position. However, our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours.  Competitive environment: The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands. We face strong, established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better cost structure or offer a better customer solution. Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competition, a change in our relative market position, an increase in inventory of finished or work-in-progress goods, or unexpected price erosion. Furthermore, there is a risk that critical suppliers could be taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors are increasingly offering services to our installed base. We address these risks with various measures, for example benchmarking, strategic initiatives, sales push initiatives, executing productivity measures and target cost projects, rightsizing of our footprint, outsourcings, mergers and joint ventures and optimizing our product and service portfolio. We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.  8.3.2 Operational risks  Cyber/Information security: Digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio. Further integration of information technology into products and services in conjunction with changing business strategies (such as outsourcing, globally distributed development, a lesser degree of sole production) are leading to an increasingly distributed supply chain, making efficient controls difficult. The fact of a large number of suppliers requires a significant effort for the initial and regular verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. Siemens business entities might lose market access if their products, solutions and services do not comply with increased regulations and legal requirements for cybersecurity in their respective countries. We observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime, which pose a risk to the security of Siemens products, solutions and services; to Siemens IT systems and networks; and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. Like other large multinational companies, we face active cyber threats from sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nation-states engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage. According to external sources of relevant data, this trend has been accelerated by geopolitical developments and tensions worldwide. Especially the numbers of phishing attacks and malicious websites have increased significantly. There is a risk that confidential information or data-privacy-relevant information may be stolen or that the integrity of our portfolio may be compromised, such as by attacks on our networks, social engineering, data manipulations in critical applications, or a loss of critical resources, resulting in financial damages and violation of data privacy laws. Moreover, the information technology market is concentrated among a small number of information technology and software vendors, which could lead to dependence on a single provider. There can be no assurance that the measures aimed at protecting our intellectual property and portfolio will address these threats under all circumstances. Cybersecurity covers the IT of our entire enterprise including office IT, systems and applications, special-purpose networks, and our operating environments such as manufacturing and R&D. We strive to mitigate these risks by employing a number of cyber defense measures, including employee training, considering new models of flexible working environments, and comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems with an artificial intelligence solution to identify attacks faster, and thereby prevent damage to society, critical infrastructures, our customers, our partners and Siemens overall. We initiated the industrial \u201cCharter of Trust,\u201d signed by a growing group of global companies, which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital world. Nonetheless, our systems, products, solutions and services, as well as those of our service providers, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Such attacks could potentially lead to the publication, manipulation or leakage of information such as through industrial espionage. They could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems, vulnerable products, production downtimes and supply shortages, with potential adverse effects on our reputation, our competitiveness and results of operations. For increased protection of Siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents, the currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  27  Supply chain management: The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components, sub-assemblies, energy, critical parts (e.g. semiconductors) and materials. Capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in the future, especially if we use single-source suppliers for critical components. Shortages and delays could materially harm our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events (including pandemics), geopolitical uncertainties, energy shortages, sabotage, cyber incidents, suppliers\u2019 financial difficulties or suppliers not meeting our standards, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.  Internal programs and initiatives: We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction initiatives, including ongoing capacity adjustment measures and structural initiatives. Consolidation of business activities and manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these cost-reduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities, there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. Furthermore, delays in critical R&D projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.  Shortage of skilled personnel: Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel, such as specialists and experts in technical fields, remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled people and a need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to attract engineers, tech talent and other qualified personnel. We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. In fiscal 2023 we rolled out our new Employer Branding in all our recruiting marketing activities and started a media campaign with focus on tech talent in our key markets. Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. In addition, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning. As with our existing people, we must also provide new talent with opportunities to grow and bond, especially soon after they join us. This appears especially relevant at a time of new, increasingly virtual working environments.  Project-related risks: A number of our segments conduct activities under long-term contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure or Portfolio Companies. Some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting post-completion warranty obligations. For example, we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. The profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contract\u2019s term. We sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key personnel, quality problems, financial difficulties of our customers and/or significant partners, cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems, unexpected developments at the project sites, unforeseen changes or difficulties in the regulatory or political environment, performance problems with our suppliers, subcontractors and consortium partners or other logistical difficulties. Some of our multi-year contracts also contain demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost and compliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantial contractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract termination. There can be no assurance that contracts and projects, in particular those with long-term duration and fixed-price calculation, can be completed profitably. To tackle those risks, we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the technical and commercial capabilities of our project management personnel. For complex projects we conduct dedicated risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers.   8.3.3 Financial risks  Risks from pension obligations: The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio. Additionally, they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design, among other factors. A significant increase in underfunding may have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs. In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to changes in funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries or to changes in the regulations themselves.  Audits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations: We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization, we conduct business in countries subject to complex tax rules, which may be interpreted in different ways. Future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.  Market price risks: We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the euro, because a high percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from Europe to regions using the U.S. dollar. In addition, we are exposed to effects involving the currencies of emerging markets, in particular the Chinese yuan. Appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could materially change our competitive position. We are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. Even hedging activities to mitigate such risks may result in a reverse effect. Fluctuations in exchange or interest rates, negative developments in the financial markets and changes"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  28  in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results. Market prices show higher volatility than in the past due to increased macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from inflation, geopolitical tensions and other factors noted above.  Liquidity and financing risks: Our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit and/or financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets, such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments; an updated evaluation of our solvency, particularly from rating agencies; negative interest rates; and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector, central bank policy, or the usage of financial instruments. Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial markets might lead to adverse changes in the market values of our financial assets, in particular our derivative financial instruments.  Credit risks: We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if, for example, customers do not meet obligations arising from these financing arrangements, meet them only partially, or meet them late. The credit environment has become more dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook (e.g. inflation) and geopolitical tensions.  For further information on post-employment benefits, derivative financial instruments, hedging activities, financial risk management and related measures, see Notes 17, 24 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.  8.3.4 Compliance risks  Changes of regulations, laws and policies: Regulatory requirements are being introduced or modified at an unprecedented rate, often with little or no advance implementation lead time. This creates a risk that new requirements become effective more quickly than they can be implemented in the associated systems and processes, potentially resulting in business disruptions and the need for manual mitigation interventions. As a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product- and country-related regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. According to observations and analysis, there is an increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change, or new ones will be set in force, which result in market access criteria that our products do not meet. The affected products would lose marketability in this market. Reducing the risk of a sales-stop depends on the required correction for the non-conformity. In case the product can technically stay as is, while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification, there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures. In a worse case, the affected product will need re-engineering or re-design to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become re-assessed and certified for market approval. The latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the country-specific product variant as an additional derivative item in the portfolio. In the worst case, if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the product\u2019s marketability prove to be not feasible, we must stop selling the affected product in the market. The uncertain geopolitical situation has triggered unpredictable \u2013 and often conflicting \u2013 extraterritorial regulations, restrictions and sanctions, thus creating a potential risk that it will be difficult to simultaneously comply with all relevant regulatory requirements of certain transactions. Complex cross-jurisdictional regulations can vary between countries, even within the same region, each with slightly different rules and requirements, creating a risk that a global standard cannot be effectively implemented and maintained, potentially leading to a need for more custom or regional standards. We monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas, with the aim of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions. However, any changes in regulations, laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations.   Current and future investigations regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law: Proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties, sanctions, injunctions against future conduct, profit disgorgements, disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business, the loss of business licenses or permits, other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties. Moreover, any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the 2008 and 2009 corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U.S. and German authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.  In its global business, Siemens does part of its business with state-owned enterprises and governments. We also participate in projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations, such as multilateral development banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business alliances, or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover, third parties, including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation.  In addition, future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations, such as responding to the requests of governmental authorities and cooperating with them, could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other issues facing our business. Furthermore, we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration.    Along with other measures, Siemens has established a global compliance organization that conducts compliance risk mitigation processes such as Compliance Risk Assessments, among others, or initiates audit activities performed by the internal assurance department.   Sanctions and export control: As a globally operating organization, we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions, debarment policies or other forms of trade restrictions (hereafter referred to as \u201csanctions\u201d) imposed by the U.S., the EU, China or other countries or organizations. New or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. We are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  29  state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, it is possible that such policies may result in our inability to gain or retain certain investors or customers. In addition, the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. Our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries or due to unauthorized diversion of our products to restricted parties or destinations. Siemens addresses these risks by maintaining a comprehensive and robust control program.  Protectionism (including tariffs/trade war): Protectionist trade policies, de-coupling and changes in the political and regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate, such as import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets, inbound and outbound investment screenings, and price or exchange controls, could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation, financial position and results of operations; we may also be exposed to penalties, other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs.  Environmental, health & safety and other governmental regulations: Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental, health, safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore, we see the risk of potential environmental, health or safety incidents as well as potential non-compliance with environmental, health or safety regulations affecting Siemens and our contractors or sub-suppliers, resulting for example in serious injuries, business interruptions, penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.  In addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties that we contract with, including suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us. Any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations.   Current or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings: Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates. Some of these legal disputes and proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens; or decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. However, the insurance policy does not protect Siemens against, in particular, reputational damage. Moreover, Siemens may incur losses relating to legal disputes and proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal disputes and proceedings. Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  For additional information with respect to specific proceedings, see Note 22 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.  8.3.5 Assessment of the overall risk situation  The most significant challenges have been mentioned first in each of the four risk categories: strategic, operational, financial and compliance.  While our assessments of individual risks have changed during fiscal 2023 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, effects of our own mitigation measures and the revision of our risk assessment, the overall risk situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. We currently see the strategic risk economic, political and geopolitical conditions as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk cyber/information security.  At present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern. 8.4 Opportunities  Within our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order in which the opportunities are presented reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these opportunities and thus provides an indication of the opportunities\u2019 current importance to us. The described opportunities are not necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.  Favorable political and regulatory environment including sustainability: A favorable political and regulatory environment including the transition towards a low-carbon economy could restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of our markets. In addition, government initiatives and subsidies (including tax reforms, green and digital recovery plans, R&D among others) lead to more government spending (e.g. infrastructure, healthcare, mobility or digitalization investments) and may ultimately result in an opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. Investments to strengthen countries\u2019 resilience, energy and food security, as well as to diversify value chains close to major markets (reshoring, nearshoring) can present opportunities to businesses. By enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emission in our own operations, Siemens strives to support the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Siemens also welcomes and supports recent"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  30  legislative and governmental measures to accelerate the mitigation of climate change, especially in Europe such as through the Green Deal or sustainable finance initiatives.  Value creation through innovation: We drive innovation by investing significantly in R&D in order to develop sustainable solutions for our customers while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Being an innovative company and constantly inventing new technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change, urbanization, digitalization, environmental change, resource scarcity and glocalization is one of our core purposes. We are granted thousands of new patents every year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and data-driven business models. This helps us create the next generation of ground-breaking innovations in such fields as digital twin, artificial intelligence, automation and edge computing. Across our operating units, we are profiting from our strength in connecting the real and digital worlds. Our Xcelerator platform is an open, digital business platform featuring a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware and software, an ecosystem and a marketplace to enhance the digital transformation of our customers. We see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through new marketing and sales strategies, which we implement in our operating units. Our position along the value chains of automation and digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration. Along these value chains, we have identified several clear growth fields in which we see our greatest long-term potential. Hence, we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth fields.  Leveraging Market Potential: Through sales and services initiatives we continuously strive to grow and extend our businesses in established markets, open up new markets for existing portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in order to gain a higher market share and increased profits. Furthermore, we aim to increase our sales via improved account management and new distribution channels.  Optimization of organization and processes: On the one hand, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure, such as common computing architecture for image processing. Furthermore, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times. On the other hand, we see an opportunity of further penetrating markets by quality initiative program and avoiding or reducing non conformance cost.  Mergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio: We constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which may complement our organic growth. Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. Opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.  Assessment of the overall opportunities situation: The most significant opportunity for Siemens is favorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability) as described above.  While our assessments of individual opportunities have changed during fiscal 2023 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, our endeavors to profit from them and revision of our strategic plans, the overall opportunity situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. 8.5 Significant characteristics of the internal control and risk management system                      8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM  Our ICS and ERM are based on the principles, guidelines and measures introduced by the Managing Board, which are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Managing Board's decisions. Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals, the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting, and compliance with the laws and regulations relevant to Siemens. Sustainability aspects are covered as well and are continuously developed based on the regulatory requirements.  Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard \u201cEnterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrating with Strategy and Performance\u201d (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized \u201cInternal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) also developed by COSO. The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS, both systems are complementary.  All Siemens entities are part of our ICS and ERM. The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different, depending, among others, on the entity\u2019s impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens and the specific risks associated with the entity. The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility, based on the group-wide mandatory methodology.   Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board. The Siemens Risk and Internal Control (RIC) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and effective processes for implementing, monitoring and reporting on internal control and ERM activities. It consists of the central RIC departments of Siemens AG and the RIC departments at our organizational units. The central RIC departments are responsible for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group.  We have an overarching, integrated ICS and ERM methodology (RIC methodology) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness. For more information on ERM, see chapter 8.2 Risk management.  Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit function and annual audit plan. Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant for our Managing Board and Audit Committee must be mandated first by Siemens Healthineers\u2019 Managing Board and Audit Committee"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  31  and subsequently by our Managing Board and Audit Committee. The audit procedures for these topics will be \u2013 where reasonable \u2013 executed by joint teams including members of our and Siemens Healthineers\u2019 internal audit functions, thus respecting the interests of both Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers.  At the end of each fiscal year, our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens \u201cIn Control\u201d-Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings. The purpose of the \"In Control\"-Statement is to provide an overview of the key elements of the ICS and ERM of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies at the end of the fiscal year, to summarize the activities undertaken to review its adequacy and effectiveness and highlight any critical control weaknesses identified as part of these activities. The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. The Siemens \u201cIn Control\u201d-Statement is supported by certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies. In the quarterly Managing Board meetings, the company-wide risk and opportunity situation is evaluated, the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS or ERM. Based on this, the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30, 2023.  Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system. For example, no system \u2013 even if deemed to be adequate and effective \u2013 can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances.  The Audit Committee is systematically integrated into our ICS and ERM. In particular, it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS, ERM and the internal audit system.   Siemens Healthineers is largely subject to the Group-wide principles for our ICS and ERM and is responsible for adhering to those principles.   The integration of Varian into our ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2023 and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities. The integration measures are planned to be completely finalized in fiscal 2024.  8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)  Our ICS and ERM also comprise a CMS aligned to the Company's risk situation which is based on the three pillars \u2013 prevent, detect and react. It includes the legal risk areas of corruption, antitrust law, data protection, money laundering, export controls as well as human rights and is based on an extensive internal set of rules: The Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCG) define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers, external partners and the public. In addition, there are extensive internal compliance regulations, including associated controls, which oblige all Siemens employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS. They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information. The compliance operating model contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works.  Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and thus enable to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks. The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools. The results of CMS that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the Company-wide ERM.  The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance with and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide. It is part of the ICS and is continuously further developed and adapted to the current Siemens guidelines. In addition, current compliance issues are discussed at the management level on a regular basis.  The entire CMS is continuously adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements. The findings from compliance risk management as well as compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for its further development.  8.5.3 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related ICS and ERM   The overarching objective of our accounting-related ICS and ERM \u2013 as part of the overarching ICS and ERM \u2013 is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner, such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Group and the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG as the parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations.  Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework, for further information see 8.5.1.  At the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS. We have a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements.  Our Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts. For Siemens AG and other companies within the Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code. The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis. Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective.  The base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries. The preparation of the closing data of most of our entities is supported by an internal shared services organization. Furthermore, other accounting activities, such as governance and monitoring activities, are usually bundled on a regional level. In particular cases, such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external experts. The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system. The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  32  Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and training. As a fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the \u201cfour eyes\u201d principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization. Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In line with our information security requirements, accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from unauthorized access. The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG.  On a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process. Management at different levels of our organization, supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility, confirms the accuracy of the financial data that has been reported to Siemens\u2019 corporate headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems.  Siemens Healthineers is subject to our Group-wide principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and is responsible for adhering to those principles.   The integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2023 and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities. The integration measures are planned to be completely finalized in fiscal 2024.  Our internal audit function systematically reviews our financial reporting integrity, our accounting-related ICS and ERM. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan (see also 8.5.1). The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related ICS. In particular, it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated ICS, the ERM and the internal audit system. Moreover, we have rules for accounting-related complaints."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  33  9. Siemens AG  The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz).  In fiscal 2023, results for Siemens AG arise mainly from the business activities of Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure and are influenced significantly by the results of subsidiaries and investments Siemens AG owns either directly or indirectly. The business development of Siemens AG is fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Siemens Group. Therefore, the foregoing explanations for the Siemens Group apply also for Siemens AG.   The Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.70 per share of no par value entitled to the dividend, from the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 amounting to \u20ac3.8 billion. The proposed dividend represents a total payout of \u20ac3.7 billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. This includes striving for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it. For fiscal 2024, we expect that net income of Siemens AG will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a commensurate dividend.   As of September 30, 2023, the number of employees was around 47.300.  9.1 Results of operations   Statement of Income of Siemens AG in accordance with German Commercial Code (condensed)               Fiscal year % Change  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022   Revenue 19,660 17,390 13%  Cost of sales (13,671) (12,502) (9)%  Gross profit 5,989 4,888 23%  as percentage of revenue 30% 28%   Research and development expenses (2,084) (1,785) (17)%  Selling and general administrative expenses (3,701) (3,283) (13)%  Other operating income (expenses), net (53) (306) 83%  Income (loss) from investments, net 4,734 4,204 13%  Interest and other financial income (expenses), net (128) (605) 79%  Income from business activity 4,758 3,115 53%  Income taxes (298) 498 n/a  Net income 4,460 3,612 23%  Profit carried forward 250 185 35%  Allocation to other retained earnings (950) (185) >-200%  Unappropriated net income 3,760 3,613 4%           On a geographical basis, 75% of revenue was generated in the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, 17% in the Asia, Australia region and 8% in the Americas region. Exports from Germany accounted for 57% of overall revenue. In fiscal 2023, orders for Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac16.1 billion.   The increases in revenue, cost of sales and research and development expenses were most evident at Digital Industries.  The R&D intensity (R&D costs as a percentage of revenue) was 10.6%, slightly above the level in fiscal 2022. The R&D activities of Siemens AG are fundamentally the same as for its corresponding business activities within the Siemens Group. R&D expenses in both periods related mainly to Digital Industries. On an average basis, Siemens AG employed 7,100 people in R&D in fiscal 2023.   The increase in selling and general administrative expenses was due mainly to higher selling expenses led by Digital Industries.  Other operating income (expenses), net, included mainly a loss of \u20ac0.2 billion from a disposal in connection with the carve-out of business activities into the Innomotics GmbH, partly offset by \u20ac0.1 billion income from an intragroup service contract. Fiscal 2022 included mainly expenses of \u20ac0.2 billion from the intragroup service contract and expenses of \u20ac0.1 billion for the recognition of a provision related to guarantees and expected obligations from consortium contracts.  Income (loss) from investments, net included mainly income from investments of \u20ac2.9 billion (fiscal 2022: \u20ac4.8 billion) and income from profit transfer agreements with affiliated companies of \u20ac1.6 billion (fiscal 2022: \u20ac3.5 billion). Additionally, in fiscal 2023 Siemens AG recorded a gain of \u20ac0.2 billion from the sale of a part of its stake in Siemens Energy AG and a gain of \u20ac0.2 billion from the reversal of an impairment on the remaining stake in Siemens Energy AG. The remaining stake held directly by Siemens AG amounted to 21.0% as of September 30, 2023. These gains were partly offset by a loss of \u20ac0.2 billion from an impairment on a stake in Thoughtworks Holding Inc. For comparison, in fiscal 2022 Siemens AG recorded losses of \u20ac4.0 billion from impairment of investments, which included an impairment of \u20ac2.9 billion on Siemens AG\u2019s stake in Siemens Energy AG, Germany.  Interest and other financial income (expenses), net included a negative interest result of \u20ac0.6 billion compared to a positive interest result of \u20ac0.4 billion a year earlier, which was driven by the effect of higher interest rates on intragroup-financing activities. Fiscal 2022 included impacts of \u20ac0.6 billion in connection with allowances on receivables from affiliated companies related to business activities in Russia, expenses from the recognition of provisions for risks relating to derivative financial instruments of \u20ac0.4 billion and a higher negative interest component of \u20ac0.3 billion from changes in pension and personnel-related provisions."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  34  9.2 Net assets and financial position   Statement of Financial Position of Siemens AG in accordance with German Commercial Code (condensed)                Sep. 30, % Change  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022   Assets     Non-current assets      Intangible and tangible assets 1,307 1,081 21%  Financial assets 71,303 71,576 0%   72,610 72,657 0%  Current assets     Inventories, receivables and other assets 26,190 30,424 (14)%  Cash and cash equivalents, other securities 2,534 1,623 56%   28,724 32,047 (10)%  Prepaid expenses 223 220 1%  Deferred tax assets 2,294 2,065 11%  Active difference resulting from offsetting 33 16 107%  Total assets 103,884 107,005 (3)%       Liabilities and equity     Equity 21,422 20,623 4%       Special reserve with an equity portion 540 540 0%  Provisions     Provisions for pensions and similar commitments 13,604 13,380 2%  Provisions for taxes and other provisions 4,666 4,313 8%   18,270 17,693 3%  Liabilities     Liabilities to banks 339 639 (47)%  Trade payables, liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities 63,079 67,275 (6)%   63,417 67,914 (7)%  Deferred income 235 235 0%  Total liabilities and equity 103,884 107,005 (3)%              The change in cash and cash equivalents, other securities relates to the liquidity management conducted by Corporate Treasury, which was focused not solely on the business activities of Siemens AG. The liquidity management is based on the financing policy of the Siemens Group, which is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Intra-group financing activities drove both a decrease of \u20ac4.5 billion in receivables from affiliated companies, which resulted in lower inventories, receivables and other assets, and a decrease of \u20ac4.5 billion in liabilities to affiliated companies, which was the main reason for the decrease of trade payables, liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities.  The increase in equity was due to net income for the year of \u20ac4.5 billion and the transfer of \u20ac0.6 billion in treasury shares to employees in connection with our share-based payment programs. These factors were partly offset by dividends paid in fiscal 2023 (for fiscal 2022) of \u20ac3.4 billion and share buybacks during the year amounting to \u20ac0.9 billion. The equity ratio as of September 30, 2023 increased to 21%, from 19% a fiscal year earlier.

Takeover-relevant information (pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code) and explanatory report  10.1 Composition of common stock  Following the cancellation of 50 million registered shares of no par value of the Company (Siemens shares) in February 2023, the Company\u2019s capital stock amounts to \u20ac2.400 billion (as of September 30, 2023), divided into 800 million Siemens shares. The shares are fully paid in. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. The shareholders\u2019 rights and obligations are governed in detail by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular by Sections 12, 53a et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 of the German Stock Corporation Act.  10.2 Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares  At the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, each share of stock has one vote and accounts for the shareholder\u2019s proportionate share in the Company\u2019s net income. An exception to this rule applies with regard to treasury shares held by the Company, which do not entitle the Company to any rights. Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.  Siemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the Siemens share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal 2009, in particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws indicate otherwise. Under the rules of the Share Matching Plan, however, in order to receive one matching share free of charge for each three shares purchased, participants are required to hold the shares purchased by them for a vesting period of several years, during which the participants must be continuously employed by Siemens AG or any of its affiliated companies. The right to receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting period.  The von Siemens-Verm\u00f6gensverwaltung GmbH (vSV) has, on a sustained basis, powers of attorney allowing it to exercise the voting rights for 10,059,581 Siemens shares (as of September 30, 2023) on behalf of members of the Siemens family. These shares are part of the total number of shares held by the family\u2019s members. The powers of attorney are based on an agreement between the vSV and, among others, members of the Siemens family. The shares are voted together by vSV, taking into account the suggestions of a family partnership established by the family\u2019s members or of one of this partnership\u2019s governing bodies.  10.3 Legislation and provisions of the Articles of Association applicable to the appointment and  removal of members of the Managing Board and governing amendment to the Articles of Association  The appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board are subject to the provisions of Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz). According to Section 8 para. 1 of the Articles of Association, the Managing Board is comprised of several members, the number of which is determined by the Supervisory Board.  According to Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act, any amendment to the Articles of Association requires a resolution of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. The authority to adopt purely formal amendments to the Articles of Association was transferred to the Supervisory Board under Section 13 para. 2 of the Articles of Association. In addition, by resolutions adopted during past Shareholders\u2019 Meetings, the Supervisory Board has been authorized to amend Section 4 of the Articles of Association in accordance with the utilization of the Authorized and Conditional Capitals, and after expiration of the then-applicable authorization and utilization period.  Resolutions of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting require a simple majority vote, unless a greater majority is required by law (Section 23 para. 2 of the Articles of Association). Pursuant to Section 179 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of Association require a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented at the time of the casting of the votes, unless another capital majority is prescribed by the Articles of Association.  10.4 Powers of the Managing Board to issue and repurchase shares  The Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until February 2, 2026 by up to \u20ac90 million through the issuance of up to 30 million Siemens shares against contributions in cash (Authorized Capital 2021). Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares shall be offered exclusively to employees of the Company and any of its affiliated companies. To the extent permitted by law, such employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.  Furthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million Siemens shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind (Authorized Capital 2019).  As of September 30, 2023, the total unissued authorized capital of Siemens AG therefore consisted of \u20ac600 million nominal that may be used, in installments with varying terms, by issuing up to 200 million Siemens shares.  By resolutions of the Shareholders\u2019 Meetings on January 30, 2019 and February 5, 2020, the Managing Board is authorized to issue bonds with conversion, exchange or option rights or conversion obligations, or a combination of these instruments, entitling the holders/creditors to subscribe to up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens shares, respectively. Based on these two authorizations, the Company or its affiliated companies may issue such convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds until January 29, 2024 and February 4, 2025, respectively, each in an aggregate principal amount of up to \u20ac15 billion. In order to grant shares of stock to holders/creditors of such convertible bonds"}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  36  and/or warrant bonds, the capital stock was conditionally increased by resolutions of the Shareholders\u2019 Meetings in 2019 and 2020, by up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens shares, respectively (Conditional Capitals 2019 and 2020), i.e. in total by up to \u20ac420 million nominal through the issuance of up to 140 million Siemens shares.  The new shares under Authorized Capital 2019 and the aforementioned bonds are to be issued against contributions in cash or in kind. They are, as a matter of principle, to be offered to shareholders for subscription. The Managing Board is authorized to exclude, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights of shareholders in the event of capital increases against contributions in kind. In the event of capital increases against contributions in cash, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders\u2019 subscription rights with the approval of the Supervisory Board in the following cases:  \u2022 The issue price of the new shares/bonds is not significantly lower than the stock market price of Siemens shares already listed or the theoretical market price of the bonds computed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial methods (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, in accordance with or by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act).  \u2022 The exclusion is necessary with regard to fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio.  \u2022 The exclusion is used to provide subscription rights as dilution compensation for holders/creditors of conversion or option rights/ obligations on Siemens shares.  The new shares issued or to be issued against contributions in cash or in kind, and with shareholders\u2019 subscription rights excluded, may in certain cases be subject to further restrictions. The details of those restrictions are described in the respective authorizations. In addition, the Managing Board has declared, by way of a voluntary commitment, not to increase the capital stock from the Authorized Capital 2019 and the Conditional Capitals 2019 and 2020 by a total of more than 10% of the capital stock existing at the time of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 5, 2020, to the extent that capital increases with shareholders\u2019 subscription rights excluded are made from the Authorized Capital 2019 against contributions in cash or in kind or to service convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds issued under the authorizations approved on January 30, 2019 or February 5, 2020 with shareholders\u2019 subscription rights excluded. This voluntary commitment ends no later than February 4, 2025.  The Company may not repurchase Siemens shares unless so authorized by a resolution duly adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting or in other very limited circumstances set forth in the German Stock Corporation Act. On February 5, 2020, the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting authorized the Company to acquire until February 4, 2025 up to 10% of its capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution or \u2013 if the value is lower \u2013 as of the date on which the authorization is exercised. The aggregate of shares of stock of Siemens AG repurchased under this authorization and any other Siemens shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable to the Company pursuant to Sections 71d and 71e of the German Stock Corporation Act may at no time exceed 10% of the then existing capital stock. Any repurchase of Siemens shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Managing Board either (1) by acquisition over the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offer or (3) through a public offer to swap Siemens shares for shares in a listed company within the meaning of Section 3 para. 2 German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board is additionally authorized to complete the repurchase of Siemens shares in accordance with the authorization described above by using certain derivatives (put and call options, forward purchases and any combination of these derivatives). In exercising this authorization, all stock repurchases based on the derivatives are limited to a maximum volume of 5% of Siemens' capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution at the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. A derivative\u2019s term of maturity may not, in any case, exceed 18 months and must be chosen in such a way that the repurchase of Siemens shares upon exercise of the derivative will take place no later than February 4, 2025.  In addition to selling over the stock exchange or through a public sales offer to all shareholders, the Managing Board is authorized by resolution of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 5, 2020 to also use Siemens shares repurchased on the basis of this or any previously given authorization for every permissible purpose. In particular such shares may be:  \u2022 retired;  \u2022 used in connection with share-based compensation programs and/or employee share programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies and issued to individuals currently or formerly employed by the Company or any of its affiliated companies as well as to board members of any of the Company\u2019s affiliated companies;  \u2022 offered and transferred, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties against non-cash contributions;  \u2022 sold by the Managing Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, against payment in cash if the price at which such Siemens shares are sold is not significantly lower than the market price of Siemens stock (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act); or  \u2022 used to service or secure obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds or warrant bonds of the Company or its affiliated companies. Moreover, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude subscription rights in order to provide subscription rights as dilution compensation for holders/creditors of conversion or option rights/obligations on Siemens shares, and to use Siemens shares to service such subscription rights.  Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to use shares acquired on the basis of this or any previously given authorization to meet obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares that were or will be agreed with members of the Managing Board within the framework of rules governing Managing Board compensation.  On June 24, 2021, the Company announced that it would launch a new five-year share buyback program, beginning in fiscal 2022. This buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and extends at the latest until September 15, 2026, is limited to a maximum value of \u20ac3 billion (excluding incidental transaction charges) on purchases of no more than 50 million Siemens shares. Using the authorization given by the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 5, 2020, Siemens repurchased 21.0 million shares by September 30, 2023 under this share buyback. This buyback has the exclusive purposes of retirement, of issuing shares to employees, board members of affiliated companies and members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, and of servicing/securing the obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds and warrant bonds.  As of September 30, 2023, the Company held 10,079,918 shares of stock in treasury."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  37  For details on the authorizations referred to above, especially the terms to exclude subscription rights, please refer to the relevant resolution and to Section 4 of the Articles of Association.  10.5 Significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of  the Company following a takeover bid  As of September 30, 2023, Siemens AG maintained lines of credit in the amount of \u20ac7.45 billion.  In January 2023, Siemens AG entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of US$250 million and in December 2022, Siemens AG entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of PLN500 million; both loan agreements have been fully drawn.  In December 2021, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of \u20ac500 million, which has been fully drawn. In addition, in March 2020 and in June 2019 respectively, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement, each of which has been drawn in the full amount of US$500 million.  The lines of credit, and the relevant loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the event that (1) Siemens AG becomes a subsidiary of another company or (2) a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires effective control over Siemens AG by being able to exercise decisive influence over its activities (Art. 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004).  Framework agreements concluded by Siemens AG under International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. documentation (ISDA Agreements) grant each counterparty a right of termination, including in certain cases of (i) a transformation (for example mergers and changes of form), (ii) an asset transfer or (iii) acquisition of ownership interests that enables the acquirer to exercise control over Siemens AG or its controlling bodies. Partially this right of termination exists only, if (1) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens AG\u2019s obligations under the ISDA Agreements or (2) the resulting entity\u2019s creditworthiness is materially weaker than Siemens AG\u2019s immediately prior to such event. Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.  10.6 Compensation agreements with members of the Managing Board or employees in the  event of a takeover bid  The contracts with the members of the Managing Board previously contained the right of the member to terminate his or her contract with the Company for good cause in the event of a change of control that results in a substantial change in the position of a Managing Board member (for example, due to a change in corporate strategy or a change in the Managing Board member\u2019s duties and responsibilities). A change of control exists if one or several shareholders acting jointly or in concert acquire a majority of the voting rights in Siemens AG and exercise a controlling influence, or if Siemens AG becomes a dependent enterprise as a result of entering into an intercompany agreement within the meaning of Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act, or if Siemens AG is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity. If this right of termination is exercised, the Managing Board member is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of no more than two years\u2019 compensation. The calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base compensation and the target amount for the bonus, but also the target amount for the stock awards, in each case based on the most recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract. The stock-based compensation components for which a firm commitment already exists will remain unaffected. Additionally, the severance payments cover non-monetary benefits by including an amount of 5% of the total severance amount. Severance payments will be reduced by 10% as a lump-sum allowance for discounted values and for income earned elsewhere. However, this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking account of the first six months of the remaining term of the Managing Board member\u2019s contract. There is no entitlement to a severance payment if the Managing Board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control. A right to terminate the contract does not exist if the change of control occurs within a period of twelve months prior to a Managing Board member\u2019s retirement.  On September 18, 2019, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should not contain such right of termination in the future. This has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020.  10.7 Other takeover-relevant information  We are not aware of, nor have we during the last fiscal year been notified of, any shareholder directly or indirectly holding 10% or more of the voting rights. There are no Siemens shares with special rights conferring powers of control. Shares of stock issued by Siemens AG to employees under its share programs and/or as share-based compensation are transferred to the employees. The beneficiary employees who hold shares of employee stock may exercise their control rights in the same way as any other shareholder in accordance with applicable laws and the Articles of Association."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  38  11. EU Taxonomy disclosure  The key performance indicators (KPI) in this section were determined based on Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 in conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable for the Consolidated Financial Statements. For calculating the eligibility and alignment KPIs, Siemens\u2019 business activities and associated revenue, capital expenditures (CapEx), and operating expenditures (OpEx) were predominantly directly mapped to an applicable economic activity listed in the Commission Delegated Acts in connection with EU regulation 2020/852. For the calculation of CapEx and OpEx, allocations were also made based on the revenue of the Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities. To avoid double counting, a mapping was always made to one economic activity only. Following the eligibility assessment, the alignment with Substantial Contribution criteria for all eligible business activities was assessed and documented based on appropriate reporting hierarchy levels, such as business-segment, product-family or project level. Once a business activity demonstrated Substantial Contribution, the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria were assessed together with technical experts on the product, site, project and/or supplier level. For fiscal 2023, EU Taxonomy reporting is limited to the first two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaption). Based on its implemented group-wide structures on risk analysis, corporate guidelines and due diligence processes and mechanisms, Siemens fulfills the Minimum Safeguards requirements, which comprise the areas of human rights, anti-corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition.  Revenue KPI  The revenue KPI shows the ratio of revenue from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to the total revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the reporting year. Based on an assessment of the Siemens business portfolio, Taxonomy-eligible revenue accounted for 20.3% and Taxonomy-aligned revenue for 16.5% of total revenue. This translates into \u20ac15.7 billion in Taxonomy-eligible revenue and \u20ac12.8 billion in aligned revenue.  Taxonomy-eligible and aligned economic activities were primarily driven by the (i) Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport (Climate Change Mitigation, CCM 3.3), (ii) rail transportation infrastructure (CCM 6.14), (iii) Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport (CCM 6.15), all associated with Mobility businesses, as well as (iv) energy-efficient building technologies (CCM 3.5) and (v) services for energy-efficient building technologies (CCM 7.5), both related to Smart Infrastructure businesses.  The difference between Taxonomy-eligible revenue and Taxonomy-aligned revenue is mainly due to DNSH criteria related to pollution prevention as part of Appendix C, which go beyond existing national regulation. This is mainly because additionally required documentation is not completely available yet.  Capital expenditures KPI  The CapEx KPI shows the ratio of CapEx from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to the total CapEx, reflecting additions (including additions from business combinations) to other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in accordance with Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the reporting year, 34.5% (\u20ac1.3 billion) of Siemens\u2019 CapEx were eligible, and 12.2% (\u20ac0.5 billion) were aligned. The aligned CapEx is composed as follows: a majority of \u20ac0.4 billion is related to additions to property, plant and equipment, the remainder pertains to internally generated intangible assets and capitalized right-of-use assets.  This aligned CapEx includes \u20ac116 million related to a CapEx plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal 2028, summing up to a planned total volume of \u20ac1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs). The buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon emissions (CCM 7.7).  Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) related to Siemens\u2019 real estate portfolio represents the largest portion in overall CapEx eligibility. The difference between Taxonomy-eligible CapEx and Taxonomy-aligned CapEx is impacted by (i) only partial availability of information on energy performance certificates for our global portfolio and (ii) energy certificates below the required threshold defined in the Substantial Contribution criteria for the energy efficiency of buildings.  Operating expenditures KPI  The OpEx KPI shows the ratio of OpEx from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to total OpEx. The total OpEx comprises direct non-capitalized costs related to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant, and equipment per Annex I of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. Accordingly, 12.4% (\u20ac0.9 billion) of Siemens\u2019 OpEx were eligible and 8.2% (\u20ac0.6 billion) were aligned.  The majority of eligible and/or aligned expenditures relate to processes and assets associated with the economic activities described for the revenue KPI: (i) Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport (CCM 3.3) and (ii) rail transportation infrastructure (CCM 6.14). These two activities account for half of eligible OpEx and the majority of aligned OpEx.  This aligned OpEx includes \u20ac3 million related to a CapEx plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal 2028, summing up to a planned total volume of \u20ac1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs). The buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon emissions (CCM 7.7).  Corresponding to revenue, the difference between Taxonomy-eligible OpEx and Taxonomy-aligned OpEx relates mainly to the documentation of DNSH criteria for pollution prevention (Appendix C)."}, {"knowledge": "Combined Management Report  Draft Confidential 39                        EU Taxonomy \u2013 Revenue    Revenue Substantial contribution criteria   DNSH criteria      Codes  Absolute  Revenue  Proportion of Revenue  Climate change mitigation  Climate change adaptation  Climate change mitigation  Climate change adaptation  Water and marine resources  Circular economy  Pollution  Biodiversity and ecosystems  Minimum safe-guards  Taxonomy-aligned proportion of revenue  Category   (E = enabling;   T = transitional)  Economic activities                           (in millions of \u20ac) % % % Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N % E/T  A.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  NOTE 1 Basis of presentation  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present the operations of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft with registered offices in Berlin (registry number HRB 12300) and Munich (registry number HRB 6684), Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Company or Siemens). They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as well as with the additional requirements set forth in Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Consolidated Financial Statements are in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Managing Board on December 4, 2023. Siemens prepares and reports its Consolidated Financial Statements in euros (\u20ac). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. Siemens is a German based multinational focused technology company.  NOTE 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates  Certain of the following accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. Siemens cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment.  Siemens operates in an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, particularly due to the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Israel-Gaza/Middle East. Notably, we face continuing inflation, increased interest rates, volatile foreign currencies and share prices along with a rising apprehension of a slow-down of economic growth in significant markets compared to prior years. Uncertainties increase in prognosis and forecasts, in applying critical accounting estimates and in using management judgements. Those trends could impact fair values and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows of Siemens. Severity and duration of those trends are decisive on the magnitude of its impact on Siemens\u2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. Siemens based its estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available.  Basis of consolidation \u2013 The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee. In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of Siemens\u2019 return.  Business combinations \u2013 Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. At the date control is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests the Company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. If the Company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.  Associates and joint ventures \u2013 Associates are companies over which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights). Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control. Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.   Associates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. Siemens\u2019 share of its associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate\u2019s or joint venture\u2019s profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When Siemens\u2019 share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens\u2019 net investment in the associate or joint venture.   Siemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. In addition, Siemens similarly assesses whether there are indications that an impairment loss recorded in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. If this is the case, any reversal of an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount subsequently increases, not exceeding the carrying amount, had no impairment loss been recognized in previous periods. Impairments and reversal of impairments include the use of judgements.  Foreign currency translation \u2013 Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the Consolidated Statements of Income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  8  Foreign currency transaction \u2013 Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.  Revenue recognition \u2013 Siemens recognizes revenue when, or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customer\u2019s creditworthiness into account. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, the Company reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.  Revenues from construction-type contracts: Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.   The percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory risks, risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.   Revenues from maintenance and service contracts: Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e. under the percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.   Revenues from product sales: Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within 30 days.  Revenues from software contracts: Software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses, which are both on-premise, as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of software-as-a-service. Subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations: time-based software license and technical support service. Revenues for perpetual and time-based licenses granting the customer a right to use Siemens\u2019 intellectual property are recognized at a point in time, i.e. when control of the license passes to the customer. Revenues for technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straight-line basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Siemens\u2019 services. Software-as-a-service contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for which revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis. Payment terms for all transactions are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.   Income from interest \u2013 Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.   Functional costs \u2013 In general, operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.  Product-related expenses \u2013 Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.  Research and development costs \u2013 Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to 25 years.   Earnings per share \u2013 Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income, all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and share-based payment plans.  Goodwill \u2013 Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units, generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.  For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s), to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that (group of) cash-generating unit(s) is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s)\u2019 fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values. These"}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  9  values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.  The determination of the recoverable amount of a (group of) cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. In determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations generally use five-year projections (in exceptional cases up to ten years) that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections consider past experience and represent management\u2019s best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.   Other intangible assets \u2013 The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from two to 30 years for customer relationships and trademarks and for technology from five to 22 years.  Property, plant and equipment \u2013 Property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. The following useful lives are assumed:     Factory and office buildings 20 to 50 years  Other buildings  5 to 10 years  Technical machinery & equipment  generally 10 years  Office & other equipment  generally 5 years  Equipment leased to others  generally 3 to 7 years     Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets \u2013 The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets\u2019 recoverable amount, which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.   Leases \u2013 A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in Notes 8, 13 and 16.  Lessor: Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. Receivables from finance leases are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Lessee: Siemens recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation expense and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. Right-of-use assets are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.  Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for disposal \u2013 Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity is classified as held for disposal or has been disposed of, if the component represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for disposal, if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. Depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside of Note 3 relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. The non-current asset held for disposal or the disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.   Income taxes \u2013 Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable tax authorities\u2019 views. Tax regulations can be complex and possibly subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management\u2019s considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, including income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning opportunities that Siemens would execute. As of each period-end, Siemens evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens\u2019s control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  10  Expected tax effects, arising from prospectively applying the global minimum taxation rules (Pillar Two), are not considered in calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. Currently, it is expected to apply Pillar Two to the entire Siemens Group commencing with fiscal 2025.  Contract assets, contract liabilities, receivables \u2013 When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a contract asset, a contract liability or a receivable depending on the relationship between Siemens\u2019 performance and the customer\u2019s payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.  Inventories \u2013 Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value, costs being generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, technical and price risks.  Defined benefit plans \u2013 Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of salary and pension increases are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year\u2019s period-end date.  Service cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.  Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.  Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.  Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.   Provisions \u2013 A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when (1) it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and (2) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and (3) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.  Significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts, warranty costs, asset retirement obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings). Siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays.   Legal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens\u2019 financial position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.  Termination benefits \u2013 Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity\u2019s offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entity\u2019s decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.  Financial instruments \u2013 A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in, financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost, measured at fair value, loan commitments, contract assets and receivables from finance leases. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. Initially, financial instruments are recognized at fair value and net of transaction costs, if not categorized at FVTPL. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned to:  Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL): a) mandatorily measured at FVTPL: Debt financial assets are measured at FVTPL if the business model they are held in is not a hold-to-collect or a hold-and-sell business model, or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is elected. b) Financial assets designated as measured at FVTPL are irrevocably designated at initial recognition if the designation significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were measured on different bases."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  11  Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.  Financial assets measured at amortized cost: Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held in a hold-to-collect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.   Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses, representing a forward-looking estimate of future credit losses involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default. Valuation allowances are not recognized as far as the gross carrying amount is sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation allowance for loans and other long-term debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services (SFS) is measured according to a three-stage impairment approach:   Stage 1: At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.  Stage 2: If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized based on a lifetime probability of default. A significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage 2, if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than 30 days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage 2, if the delay is not credit-risk-related.   Stage 3: If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial asset.  Financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtor\u2019s sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.  A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition.   Cash and cash equivalents \u2013 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.  Loan Commitments \u2013 Expected credit losses for irrevocable loan commitments are determined using the three-stage impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.  Financial liabilities \u2013 except for derivative financial instruments, Siemens measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method.   Derivative financial instruments \u2013 Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax). Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.  Fair value hedges: The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities that result from meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities.   Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.  Share-based payment \u2013 Share-based payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equity-settled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the price of the underlying shares, considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and, accordingly, are accounted as equity-settled.  Insurance contracts \u2013 In June 2020, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (IFRS 17), effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Siemens will adopt the standard commencing with fiscal 2024. IFRS 17 introduces and applies uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance contracts. The adoption of IFRS 17 is not expected to have a significant impact on Siemens\u2019 Consolidated Financial Statements.  Prior-year information \u2013 The presentation of certain prior-year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  12  NOTE 3 Acquisitions and dispositions  Acquisitions   In fiscal 2023, Siemens completed several individually minor acquisitions for a total purchase price of \u20ac373 million, mainly paid in cash. In fiscal 2022 acquisitions totaled \u20ac2.0 billion. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the (preliminary) purchase price allocations resulted in Other intangible assets of \u20ac180 million and \u20ac1.1 billion, respectively, and in Goodwill of \u20ac203 million and \u20ac1.5 billion, respectively. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The purchase price allocation for some of the acquired businesses is preliminary, as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized.  Disposals  In November 2022, Siemens sold its Commercial Vehicles business for a consideration of \u20ac184 million in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain on the disposal of \u20ac148 million, which is presented in Other operating income. The business was previously reported at Portfolio Companies.

The fair value of our investment in Siemens Energy AG is \u20ac2.5 billion and \u20ac2.9 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, determined based on Siemens Energy\u2019s market capitalization (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens Energy AG added a loss to Share of profit (loss), net of \u20ac(1,478) million and \u20ac(207) million, respectively. The loss includes Siemens\u2019 share of Siemens Energy AG\u2019s net losses of \u20ac(1,405) million and \u20ac(142) million as well as effects from fair value adjustments at initial recognition of \u20ac(73) million and \u20ac(65) million, respectively. In fiscal 2023, Siemens Energy AG acquired and redeemed shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. from the minority shareholders. The acquisition and redemption of shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. reduced equity within Siemens Energy AG\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Recognizing Siemens\u2019 share in this equity transaction decreased the carrying amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG by \u20ac1,553 million, which is recognized in Equity directly. In March 2023, Siemens Energy AG completed a capital increase, in which Siemens did not participate. The transaction decreased Siemens\u2019 stake in Siemens Energy AG from 35.1% to 31.9%, which resulted in a gain of \u20ac235 million, disclosed in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and in Reconciling items of Segment information. As of March 31, 2023, the recoverable amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG of \u20ac5.2 billion, determined based on its market capitalization (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy), increased significantly compared to the level when the impairment was recorded in fiscal 2022. This triggered a partial reversal of the previous impairment of \u20ac1,594 million, which is included in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and in Reconciling items of Segment information. In June 2023, Siemens contributed a 6.8% stake in Siemens Energy AG (54 million shares) to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. at fair value (share price of \u20ac15.67; Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). Siemens\u2019 stake in Siemens Energy AG declined from 31.9% to 25.1%. The contribution resulted in a gain of \u20ac318 million disclosed at Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and at Reconciling items of Segment information.

Key assumptions on which Siemens based its determinations of the fair value less costs to sell for the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) being part of the segments include terminal value growth rates up to 1.9% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, and after-tax discount rates of 7.5% to 9.5% in fiscal 2023 and 6.5% to 9.0% in fiscal 2022.  To estimate the fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, cash flows were projected for the next five years (in exceptional cases up to ten years) based on past experience, actual operating results and management\u2019s best estimate about future developments as well as market assumptions. The determined fair value of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Siemens Financial Services\u2019 discount rate represents its specific cost of equity. The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units by taking into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country specific premiums. The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information. The peer group is subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.  The following table presents key assumptions used to determine fair value less costs to sell for impairment test purposes for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated:       Sep 30, 2023  (in millions of \u20ac) Goodwill  Terminal value growth rate  After-tax discount rate  Varian of Siemens Healthineers 7,874 1,9% 8,5%  Digital Industries 7,828 1,9% 9,5%  Imaging of Siemens Healthineers 6,782 1,9% 8,0%          Revenue figures in the detailed forecast planning period of the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated are based on average revenue growth rates (excluding portfolio effects) of between 7.3% and 8.4% (8.3% and 10.3% in fiscal 2022).          Sep 30, 2022  (in millions of \u20ac) Goodwill  Terminal value growth rate  After-tax discount rate  Digital Industries 8,226 1.9% 9.0%  Varian of Siemens Healthineers 8,134 1.9% 8.0%  Imaging of Siemens Healthineers 7,260 1.9% 7.5%       The sensitivity analysis for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated was based on a reduction in after-tax future cash flows by 10% or an increase in after-tax discount rates by one percentage point or a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by one percentage point. Siemens concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill in any of these groups of cash-generating units."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  18  NOTE 13 Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment                            Additions                  (in millions of \u20ac)  Gross  carrying amount 10/01/2022  Translation  differences  Additions through business combi-nations    Reclassi-fications  Retire- ments\u00b9  Gross   carrying  amount   09/30/2023  Accumu- lated depre- ciation/am- ortization and impair- ment  Carrying  amount 09/30/2023   Deprecia- tion/amorti- zation and impairment in fiscal   2023  Internally generated technology 4,215 (150) \u2212 301 \u2212 (202) 4,165 (2,170) 1,995 (168)  Acquired technology including patents,            licenses and similar rights 8,383 (490) 43 48 \u2212 (102) 7,882 (4,465) 3,417 (702)  Customer relationships and trademarks 9,484 (438) 160 \u2212 \u2212 (1,007) 8,200 (2,971) 5,229 (451)  Other intangible assets 22,082 (1,077) 203 349 \u2212 (1,310) 20,247 (9,605) 10,641 (1,321)               Land and buildings 10,610 (425) 1 831 424 (548) 10,894 (5,073) 5,821 (753)  Technical machinery and equipment 5,190 (177) \u2212 289 215 (185) 5,333 (3,691) 1,642 (307)  Office and other equipment 5,742 (223) 15 748 103 (485) 5,900 (4,482) 1,418 (674)  Equipment leased to others 4,025 (149) \u2212 643 12 (675) 3,857 (2,088) 1,769 (543)  Advances to suppliers and            construction in progress 1,359 (41) \u2212 742 (755) (8) 1,296 (8) 1,288 (2)  Property, plant and equipment 26,926 (1,015) 17 3,252 \u2212 (1,901) 27,280 (15,342) 11,938 (2,279)              1 Includes assets reclassified to Assets classified as held for disposal and dispositions of those entities.

NOTE 17 Post-employment benefits  Defined benefit plans  The defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company. Only to a certain extent, those plans are affected by longevity, inflation and compensation increases and take country specific differences into account. The Company\u2019s major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. The defined benefit plans cover 442,000 participants, including 183,000 actives, 82,000 deferreds with vested benefits and 177,000 retirees and surviving dependents.  Germany  In Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans. The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV. Those benefits are based predominantly on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.   In the U.S., the Pension Plans are sponsored by Siemens, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary for the management of the assets of the Plans. The Plans\u2019 assets are held in Trusts and the trustees of the Trusts are responsible for the administration of the assets of the Trusts, taking directions from the Investment Committee. The Plans are subject to the funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At their discretion, sponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries.   Pension benefits are mainly offered through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of the majority of accrued benefits is mandatory. The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based on legal requirements. Due to deviating guidelines for the determination of the discount rates, the technical funding deficit is usually larger than the IFRS funding deficit. To reduce the deficit Siemens entered into an agreement with the trustees to provide annual payments of \u00a331 (\u20ac35) million until fiscal 2033. The agreement also provides for a cumulative advance payment by Siemens AG compensating the remaining annual payments at the date of early termination of the agreement due to cancellation or insolvency."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  23  Switzerland  Following the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees. Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by external foundations. The board of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance the benefits. The Company is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the plan rules. In case of an underfunded plan the Company together with the employees may be asked to pay supplementary contributions according to a well-defined framework of recovery measures.

As in prior years, sensitivity determinations apply the same methodology as those applied in determining post-employment benefit obligations. Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO solely for the assumption changed.  Asset Liability Matching Strategies  As a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plans\u2019 funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters. Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching). Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk). The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis under consultation of senior external experts. Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation.

Environmental clean-up costs relate to remediation and environmental protection liabilities which have been accrued based on the estimated costs of decommissioning the site for the production of uranium and mixed-oxide fuel elements in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for a nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a contract under public-law, based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, regarding conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility \u201cSchacht Konrad\u201d or a logistics depot until year-end 2032. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the provisions total \u20ac480 million and \u20ac487 million, respectively."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  26  Other includes provisions for life and industrial business reinsurance contracts (liability, property, construction) in connection with the Siemens Energy business of \u20ac267 million and \u20ac339 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022; thereof life \u20ac145 million and \u20ac159 million and industrial business \u20ac122 million and \u20ac180 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. The provisions are for incurred and reported insurance losses as well as for incurred, hence, not yet reported insurance losses as of fiscal year-end. The provision is determined using actuarial standard valuation methodologies, which are parameterized based on historical loss data. Life reinsurance contracts have an average term of 19 years, whereas the cash outflows for the industrial business reinsurance contracts are expected within the next five years. Other also includes provisions for Legal Proceedings, as far as the risks that are subject to such Legal Proceedings are not already covered by project accounting. Provisions for Legal Proceedings amounted to \u20ac227 million and \u20ac236 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, \u20ac260 million and \u20ac181 million are included for claims and charges resulting from the construction business. Furthermore, Other includes provision for indemnifications in connection with dispositions of businesses of \u20ac82 million and \u20ac92 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. Such indemnifications may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.  NOTE 19 Equity  As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Siemens\u2019 issued capital is divided into 800 million and 850 million registered shares, respectively, with no par value and a notional value of \u20ac3.00 per share. The shares are paid in full. At the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, each share has one vote and accounts for the shareholders\u2019 proportionate share in the Company\u2019s net income. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby reducing issued capital by \u20ac150 million to \u20ac2.4 billion.  In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens repurchased 6,853,091 shares and 14,185,791 shares, respectively. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Siemens transferred 4,227,344 and 4,376,201 treasury shares, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company has treasury shares of 10,079,918 and 57,454,171 respectively.  Share based payment expenses increased Capital reserve by \u20ac444 million and \u20ac376 million (including non-controlling interests), respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022. In connection with the settlement of share based payment awards, Siemens treasury shares (at cost) were transferred to employees amounting to \u20ac265 million and \u20ac257 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022, which decreased Capital reserve and Retained earnings by \u20ac221 million and \u20ac44 million, respectively in 2023 and by \u20ac191 million and \u20ac66 million in fiscal 2022.  As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, total authorized capital of Siemens AG is \u20ac600 million nominal issuable in installments based on various time-limited authorizations, by issuance of up to 200 million registered shares of no par value. Siemens AG\u2019s conditional capital is \u20ac420.6 million or 140.2 million shares as of September 30, 2023 and 2022; which, primarily, can be used to serve convertible bonds or warrants under warrant bonds that could or can be issued based on various time-limited authorizations approved by the respective Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.  Dividends paid per share were \u20ac4.25 and \u20ac4.00, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022. The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board propose to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.70 per share to holders entitled to dividends, in total representing approximately \u20ac3.7 billion in expected payments. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval at the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 8, 2024.   NOTE 20 Additional capital disclosures  A key consideration of our capital structure management is to maintain ready access to capital markets through various debt instruments and to sustain our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. In order to achieve our target, Siemens intends to maintain an Industrial net debt divided by EBITDA (continuing operations) ratio of up to 1.5 in accordance with our Financial Framework. The ratio indicates the approximate number of years that would be needed to cover the Industrial net debt through Income from continuing operations, excluding interest, other financial income (expenses), taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments.

Accordingly, debt in a hedging relationship is adjusted for fair values of interest hedges as well as for foreign currency hedge effects.    Siemens deducts resulting changes in fair value, to derive an amount of debt that approximates the amount that will be repaid.    2 The adjustment considers that both Moody\u2019s and S&P view Siemens Financial Services as a captive finance company. These rating agencies generally recognize and accept higher levels of debt attributable to captive     finance subsidiaries in determining credit ratings. Following this concept, Siemens excludes Siemens Financial Services debt."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  27  The SFS business is capital intensive and operates with a larger amount of debt to finance its operations compared to the industrial business.

Additionally, credit guarantees are issued in the course of the SFS business. Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations. The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line. These guarantees have typically residual terms of up to three years (in fiscal 2022 four years). The Company held collateral mainly through inventories and trade receivables. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Credit guarantees include \u20ac95 million and \u20ac123 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy. Siemens accrued \u20ac18 million and \u20ac2 million relating to credit guarantees as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Furthermore, Siemens issues performance guarantees, which mainly include performance bonds. In the event of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations by the primary obligor, Siemens will be required to pay up to an agreed-upon maximum amount. These agreements typically have terms of up to ten years. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Performance guarantees include \u20ac5,341 million and \u20ac8,562 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy; the related contract liability amount for parent company guarantees is generally reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the underlying delivery or service agreement. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company accrued \u20ac58 million and \u20ac54 million, respectively, relating to performance guarantees.  As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, in addition to guarantees disclosed in the table above, there are contingent liabilities of \u20ac402 million and \u20ac421 million which mainly result from other guarantees and legal proceedings. Other guarantees include \u20ac71 million and \u20ac99 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.   NOTE 22 Legal proceedings  Siemens is involved in numerous Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions. These Legal Proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be extended. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.   Some of these Legal Proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens, which may have material effects on its business activities as well as its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   For Legal Proceedings information required under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed if the Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter.  Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations   As previously reported, in July 2008, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (OTE) filed a lawsuit against Siemens AG with the district court of Munich, Germany, seeking to compel Siemens AG to disclose the outcome of its internal investigations with respect to OTE. OTE seeks to obtain information with respect to allegations of undue influence and/or acts of bribery in connection with contracts concluded between Siemens AG and OTE from calendar 1992 to 2006. At the end of July 2010, OTE expanded its claim and requested"}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  28  payment of damages by Siemens AG of at least \u20ac57 million to OTE for alleged bribery payments to OTE employees. In October 2014, OTE increased its damage claim to the amount of at least \u20ac68 million. Siemens AG continues to defend itself against the expanded claim.   As previously reported, in May 2014, the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo initiated a lawsuit against Siemens Ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL2.5 billion (approximately \u20ac471 million as of September 2023) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between 2008 and 2011. In January 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo and two customers against Siemens Ltda., Siemens AG and other companies and individuals claiming damages in an unspecified amount. In March 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL487 million (approximately \u20ac92 million as of September 2023) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in 2000 and 2002. In September 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted another lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL918 million (approximately \u20ac173 million as of September 2023) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in 2006 and 2007. Siemens is defending itself against these actions. It cannot be excluded that further significant damage claims will be brought by customers or the state against Siemens.  As previously reported, in June 2015, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with public administrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In June 2018, the court accepted Siemens\u2019 appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. In June 2021, the court referred the case back to the court of first instance. In February 2018, the Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico in Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set of facts, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a ten year term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. Siemens Ltda. is currently not excluded from participating in public tenders.

Fair value of debt instruments, is either based on prices provided by price service agencies or is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates.  Fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined in accordance with the specific type of instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument. Interest rate futures are valued based on quoted market prices, if available. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates. Options are generally valued based on quoted market prices or based on option pricing models. No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e.g. firm commitments and forecast transactions) are considered.  The Company limits default risks resulting from derivative financial instruments by generally transacting with financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of investment grade. Based on Siemens\u2019 net risk exposure towards the counterparty, the resulting credit risk is considered via a credit valuation adjustment.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk management   Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship  The Company manages its risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, debt, firm commitments and forecast transactions primarily through a Company-wide portfolio approach. Under this approach the Company-wide risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency"}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  32  swaps and options, are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company also accounts for foreign currency derivatives, which are embedded in sale and purchase contracts.   Cash flow hedges  The Company\u2019s operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk mainly results from contracts denominated in US$ both from Siemens\u2019 operating units entering into long-term contracts e.g. from the project business and from the standard product business. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the risk is hedged against the euro at an average rate of 1.2780 \u20ac/US$ and 1.2293 \u20ac/US$ (forward purchases of US$), respectively, and 1.1027 \u20ac/US$ and 1.0258 \u20ac/US$ (forward sales of US$), respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the hedging transactions have an average remaining maturity until 2028 and 2027 (forward purchases of US$) as well as 2024 and 2023 (forward sales of US$), respectively.   Included are Siemens\u2019 foreign currency forward contracts, entered into in fiscal 2021, to hedge foreign currency risks relating to US$10 billion (\u20ac10 billion) bonds granted to Siemens Healthineers, through which a synthetic Euro financing structure is achieved. It factually, also turns interest into \u20ac with volume weighted average interest rates of currently about 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022.  Interest rate risk management  Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship  Interest rate risk management uses derivative financial instruments under a portfolio-based approach to manage interest risk actively. The approach does not qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses in connection with interest rate swap agreements are recorded in Other financial income (expenses), net. The interest rate risk management includes SFS business, for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.  Cash flow hedges of floating-rate commercial papers  In September 2023, Siemens ended cash flow hedge accounting. Previously, Siemens applied cash flow hedge accounting to a revolving portfolio of floating-rate commercial papers of nominal US$200 million.  Fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt obligations  Under interest rate swap agreements outstanding in fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company agreed to pay a variable rate of interest multiplied by a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest multiplied by the same notional principal amount. These interest rate swap agreements offset future changes in interest rates designated as hedged risk on the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt obligations. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the carrying amounts of \u20ac13,164 million and \u20ac10,718 million, respectively, of fixed-rate debt obligations are designated in fair value hedges, including \u20ac(876) million and \u20ac(973) million cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. Unamortized fair value hedge adjustments of \u20ac112 million and \u20ac169 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relate to no longer applied hedge accounting. The amounts are amortized over the remaining term of the underlying debt, maturing until 2042. Carrying amount adjustments to debt of \u20ac(95) million and \u20ac1,273 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022 are included in Other financial income (expenses), net; the related swap agreements resulted in gains (losses) of \u20ac74 million and \u20ac(1,236) million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Net cash receipts and payments relating to such interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expenses.  The Company had interest rate swap contracts to pay variable rates of interest of an average of 3.00% and (0.86% as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively and received fixed rates of interest (average rate of 1.81% and 1.07%, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively). The notional amount of indebtedness hedged as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was \u20ac13,687 million and \u20ac11,719 million, respectively. This changed 33% and 26% of the Company\u2019s underlying notes and bonds from fixed interest rates into variable interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The notional amounts of these contracts mature at varying dates based on the maturity of the underlying hedged items. The net fair value of interest rate swap contracts (excluding accrued interest) used to hedge indebtedness as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was \u20ac(844) million and \u20ac(959) million, respectively.  NOTE 25 Financial risk management  Increasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for Siemens. The Company\u2019s operating business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across Siemens' segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks. The Company seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.  Foreign currency exchange rate risk is quantified based on a sensitivity analysis. In order to quantify remaining market risks Siemens has implemented a system based on Value at Risk (VaR), which is also used for internal management of Corporate Treasury activities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level.  Actual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamental conceptual differences. While the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss, which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical"}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  33  probability that losses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature.   Any market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments that our Company\u2019s pension plans hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.  Foreign currency exchange rate risk  Transaction risk  Each Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business, Siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.   Operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis. Intercompany financing or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.  According to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.  Generally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury. By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.  The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a reasonably possible change in the euro versus the most important currency exchange rates compared to the respective year-end exchange rates. The analysis does not include effects of foreign currency translation. The effect on net income is due to changes in the fair values of monetary assets and liabilities including non-designated foreign currency derivatives and embedded derivatives. The effect on equity is due to changes in the fair values of forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. In fiscal 2023, the sensitivity of net income with regard to the U.S. dollar decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to a decrease of monetary assets and liabilities and a higher hedge ratio. The sensitivity of equity with regard to the U.S. dollar decreased due to a decline in the nominal amount of U.S. dollar forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.  Translation risk  Many Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. To consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Company\u2019s consolidated equity position.  Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Company\u2019s position with regard to interest rate risk, interest income and interest expenses, Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach and results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar, British pound and euro. This includes SFS business, for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.  If there are no conflicting country-specific regulations, all Siemens operating units generally obtain any required financing through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units.   As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the VaR relating to the interest rate was \u20ac683 million and \u20ac864 million. The decrease was driven mainly by a decrease in interest rate sensitivity for the U.S. dollar and a lower interest rate volatility for the euro.

Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Siemens mitigates liquidity risk by the implementation of effective working capital and cash management, arranged credit facilities with highly rated financial institutions, via a debt issuance program and via a global multi-currency commercial paper program. Liquidity risk may also be mitigated by the Siemens Bank GmbH, which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing.   In addition, Siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets, as well as trends in the availability and costs of such funding, with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks.  The following table reflects our contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based on the earliest date on which Siemens could be required to pay. Cash outflows for financial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at September 30, 2023.

Credit risk  Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is failing to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines.  Siemens provides its customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing particularly in connection with large projects. Hence, credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.   The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.   Siemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units from the Siemens Group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency.  Ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens\u2019 credit default experiences. Internal ratings consider appropriate forward-looking information relevant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the debtor\u2019s financial position, ownership, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry-related and competitive developments. The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. Ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as Siemens' public and private customers, which are determined by internal risk assessment specialists, are continuously updated and considered for investments in cash and cash equivalents and in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.   An exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than 90 days past due, or a default rating by an external rating agency.  To analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes. A main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.   The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial asset\u2019s credit risk, without taking account of any collateral. Collateral reduces the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account. Those collaterals are mostly held in the portfolio of SFS.   As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, collateral of \u20ac863 million and \u20ac1,444 million, respectively, relate to financial assets measured at fair value. Those collaterals are provided in connection with netting agreements for derivatives providing protection from the risk of a counterparty\u2019s insolvency. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, collateral held for credit-impaired receivables from finance leases amounted to \u20ac66 million and \u20ac53 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, collateral held for financial assets measured at amortized cost amounted to \u20ac3,918 million and \u20ac3,817 million, respectively, including \u20ac135 million and \u20ac108 million, respectively, for"}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  35  credit-impaired loans in SFS\u2019 asset finance business. Those collaterals mainly comprised property, plant and equipment. Credit risks arising from irrevocable loan commitments are equal to the expected future pay-offs resulting from these commitments.   SFS\u2019 external financing portfolio disaggregates into credit risk rating grades as of September 30, 2023 as follows (pre valuation allowances):                         Loans and other debt   instruments under the general approach  Financial guarantees and  loan commitments  (in millions of \u20ac) Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3  Lease Re-ceivables  Investment Grade Ratings 6,074 4 n/a 840 n/a n/a 2,512  Non-Investment Grade Ratings 16,017 548 918 2,857 67 118 3,593               Trade receivables of operating units are generally rated internally; as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, approximately 45% and 45%, respectively, have an investment grade rating and 55% and 55%, respectively, have a non-investment grade rating. Contract assets generally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operating units.  Amounts above do not represent economic credit risk, since they consider neither collateral held nor valuation allowances already recognized.  Equity Price Risk  Siemens\u2018 investment portfolio consists of direct and indirect investments in publicly traded companies that are classified as long term investments. These investments are monitored based on their current market value, affected primarily by fluctuations on the volatile technology-related markets worldwide. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the market value of Siemens\u2019 portfolio was \u20ac182 million and \u20ac339 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the VaR relating to the equity price was \u20ac26 million and \u20ac74 million. NOTE 26 Share-based payment  Share-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of Siemens AG, in treasury shares or in cash. Share-based payment awards may forfeit if the employment of the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, expense from equity-settled awards on a continuing basis are \u20ac444 million and \u20ac377 million; cash-settled awards on a continuing basis resulted in expenses of \u20ac18 million and gains of \u20ac12 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Included is expense of \u20ac113 million and \u20ac110 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, relating to Siemens Healthineers plans. Siemens Healthineers plans are largely similar to Siemens\u2019 plans, except for granting Siemens Healthineers AG shares.  Stock awards  Stock awards granted by Siemens are distinguished between a) subject to performance conditions and b) no performance conditions. Stock awards entitle the beneficiaries to Siemens shares without payment of consideration at the end of the respective vesting period.   Stock awards subject to performance conditions   The Company grants stock awards subject to performance conditions to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees. The vesting period for awards granted to members of the senior management and other eligible employees is three years respectively four years for awards granted prior to fiscal 2022. Awards granted to members of the Managing Board are subject to a four year vesting period.   For stock awards subject to performance conditions, 80% of the target amount is linked to the relative total shareholder return of Siemens compared to the total shareholder return of the MSCI World Industrials sector index (TSR-Target); the remaining 20% are linked to a Siemens internal sustainability target considering environmental, social and governance targets (ESG-Target). The annual target amount for stock awards up to and including tranche 2019 is linked to the share price performance of Siemens relative to the share price performance of five important competitors. The target attainment for each individual performance criteria ranges between 0% and 200%. Settlement of the awards is in shares corresponding to the actual target attainment.   Commitments to members of the Managing Board   Fair values of TSR-related stock awards granted are \u20ac7 million and \u20ac6 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022, calculated by applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 26.71% and 24.41%, respectively, and a Siemens share price of \u20ac130.68 and \u20ac153.34. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities.

The shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens until the end of the vesting period.   Monthly Investment Plan  Under the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified part of their compensation in Siemens shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelve months. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a month. If the Managing Board decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Plan are transferred to the Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above with a vesting period of about two years. The Managing Board decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal 2022 and 2021 are transferred to the Share Matching Plan as of February 2023 and February 2022, respectively.

Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements  Siemens Energy Investment \u2013 includes our investment in Siemens Energy accounted for using the equity method, and previously, a smaller investment in connection with Siemens Energy sold in fiscal 2022.  Siemens Real Estate (SRE) \u2013 Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions.  Innovation \u2013 mainly includes results from our units Technology and Next47.  Governance \u2013 primarily includes Siemens brand fees and governance costs, group managing costs, IT and corporate services.  Centrally carried pension expense \u2013 includes the Company\u2019s pension related income (expense) not allocated to the segments, POC or Siemens Real Estate.  Financing, eliminations and other items \u2013 comprise activities of Advanta and Global Business Services, results from corporate projects, equity interests and activities generally intended for closure as well as activities remaining from divestments, consolidation of transactions within the segments, certain reconciliation and reclassification items as well as central financing activities. It also includes interest income and expense, such as, for example, interest not allocated to segments or POC (referred to as financing interest), interest related to central financing activities or resulting consolidation and reconciliation effects on interest.   Measurement \u2013 Segments  Accounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment information is disclosed for continuing operations. For internal and segment reporting purposes, intercompany lease transactions, however, are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for off-balance sheet by the lessee (except for intercompany leases with Siemens Healthineers as lessees). Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.  Revenue  Revenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, lease revenue is \u20ac1,004 million and \u20ac1,104 million, respectively. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, Digital industries recognized \u20ac5,067 million and \u20ac4,691 million revenue, respectively, from its software business, Smart Infrastructure recognized \u20ac4,243 million and \u20ac3,856 million in its service business. Revenues of Mobility are mainly derived from construction-type business.   Profit  Siemens\u2019 Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments (chief operating decision maker). The Company\u2019s profitability measure of the segments except for SFS is earnings before interest, certain pension costs, income taxes and amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker (Profit). The major categories of items excluded from Profit are described below.  Interest income (expenses) are excluded from Profit. Decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.  Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.  Amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations are not part of Profit. Furthermore, income taxes are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit, if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, SRE and (or) POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments."}, {"knowledge": "Consolidated Financial Statements  40  Profit of the segment SFS  In contrast to performance measurement principles applied to other segments, interest income and expenses are included, since interest is an important source of revenue and expense of SFS.  Asset measurement principles  Management determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of the segments except for SFS. Its definition corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not part of Profit, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments\u2019 Assets. Segment Assets is based on Total assets of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding intragroup financing receivables, tax related assets and assets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from Profit. The remaining assets are reduced by non-interest-bearing liabilities other than tax related liabilities, e.g. trade payables, to derive Assets. In contrast, Assets of SFS is Total assets. In individual cases assets of Mobility include project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects. Assets of Siemens Healthineers include real estate, while real estate of all other segments is carried at SRE.  Orders  Orders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens considers termination rights and customer\u2019s creditworthiness.   As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, order backlog totaled \u20ac111 billion and \u20ac102 billion (continuing operations); thereof Digital Industries \u20ac11 billion and \u20ac14 billion, Smart Infrastructure \u20ac16 billion and \u20ac15 billion, Mobility \u20ac45 billion and \u20ac36 billion and Siemens Healthineers \u20ac34 billion and \u20ac34 billion. In fiscal 2024, Siemens expects to convert approximately \u20ac43 billion of the September 30, 2023 order backlog into revenue; thereof at Digital Industries approximately \u20ac8 billion, Smart Infrastructure approximately \u20ac10 billion, Mobility approximately \u20ac11 billion and Siemens Healthineers approximately \u20ac11 billion.  Free cash flow definition  Free cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Except for SFS, it excludes financing interest, except for cases where interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it also excludes income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds. Free cash flow of SFS includes related financing interest payments and proceeds; income tax payments and proceeds of SFS are excluded. In individual cases, free cash flow of Mobility includes project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects.   Amortization, depreciation and impairments  Amortization, depreciation and impairments includes depreciation and impairments of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net of reversals of impairment.  Measurement \u2013 POC and Siemens Real Estate  POC follows the measurement principles of the segments except for SFS. Siemens Real Estate applies the measurement principles of SFS.  Additional segment information  The orderly wind down of business activities in Russia resulted in losses in Profit of Mobility of \u20ac0.6 billion in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, subsequent to the wind down, Profit of Mobility carried related gains of \u20ac153 million, which mainly stem from the reversal of provisions and obligations as well as from the reversal of write downs and the sale of inventories.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited chapter 11 \u201cEU Taxonomy disclosure\u201d of the group management report, the sections \u201c8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM\u201d and \u201c8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)\u201d in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,   \u2022 the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB [\u201cHandelsgesetzbuch\u201d: German Commercial Code] as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as of September 30, 2023 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, and   \u2022 the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group\u2019s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover chapter 11 \u201cEU Taxonomy disclosure\u201d of the group management report, the sections \u201c8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM\u201d and \u201c8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)\u201d in chapter 8.5 of the group management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.   Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.  Basis for the opinions  We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \u201cEU Audit Regulation\u201d) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the \u201cAuditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\u201d section of our auditor\u2019s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.    Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.   Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:  Revenue recognition on construction-type contracts  Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group conducts a significant portion of its business under construction-type contracts, particularly in the Mobility business. Revenue from long-term construction-type contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method. We consider the accounting for construction-type contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement (including the potential risk of management override of internal controls) and accordingly a key audit matter, because management\u2019s assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include, in particular, the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations, total estimated contract costs, remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues, as well as contract risks including technical, political, regulatory, legal and supply chain risks."}, {"knowledge": "Independent Auditor\u2019s Reports (Group)    3  Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction-type contract.   The effects of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments on the project business, such as delays in project execution, price increases or disruptions in supply chains and their accounting treatment were taken into account during our audit.  Auditor\u2019s response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group\u2019s internally established methods, processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction-type contracts. In this regard, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of business transactions specific to construction-type contracts, from the initiation of the transaction through presentation in the consolidated financial statements. We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates, the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation as well as their accounting treatment.   As part of our substantive audit procedures, which particularly involved project reviews, we evaluated management\u2019s estimates and assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks, such as projects with complex safety/technical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers or consortium partners, fixed-price or turnkey projects, cross-border projects and projects with changes in cost estimates, delays and/or low or negative margins.   Our audit procedures included, among others, review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services, termination rights, penalties for delay and breach of contract, liquidated damages as well as joint and several liability. In order to evaluate whether revenues were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects, we analyzed revenues attributable to the fiscal year and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income considering the extent of progress towards completion and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position.   For this we also assessed the accounting for contractually agreed options, contract amendments or contract terminations (including related pending legal proceedings) also in relation to previous construction-type contracts with Russian customers. We also assessed the recognition requirements of reimbursement claims.  We further performed inquiries of project management (both commercial and technical project managers) with respect to the development of the projects, the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs, the current estimated costs to complete the projects, and management\u2019s assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize.   To identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs, we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures, we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyers\u2019 confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims) and inspected the status of projects at plant sites. Due to the large contract volume and risk profile, our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of high-speed and commuter trains.  Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on construction-type contracts.   Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for construction-type contracts, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks, refer to Note 10 Contract assets and liabilities, Note 18 Provisions and Note 21 Commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG  Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Since the spin-off of Siemens Energy AG in September 2020, Siemens AG has held a 35.1% stake in the listed Siemens Energy AG which was reduced to 25.1% due to capital measures at Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. in fiscal year 2023. The investment is accounted for as an associate, applying the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. As of June 30, 2022, an impairment was recognized on the investment. During the first six months of the financial year 2023, the market capitalization of the investment was mostly higher than the value at the time of the impairment. As of March 31, 2023, the latter was significantly exceeded. As a result, an impairment reversal was made in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, in the amount of the increase in the stock market price since the date of the impairment until March 31, 2023. In addition, Siemens Energy AG acquired additional shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. in fiscal year 2023. This led to a reduction in equity in the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Energy AG. The recognition of Siemens\u2019 share in this equity transaction resulted in a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, which was recognized directly in Siemens\u2019 equity. As of September 30, 2023, the pro rata market value of the investment was above the book value.  Due to the judgments and estimates by management in the analyses and assessments with regards to possible impairments or reversals of impairments as well as the overall material implications for the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group and the related significant risk of material misstatement, the assessment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG is one of the key audit matters.  Auditor\u2019s response: As part of our audit procedures in relation to management\u2019s assessment regarding the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we examined the methods and processes defined internally for the identification of indicators for a reversal of an impairment and thus the timing of a possible reversal of an impairment as well as the measurement of a reversal of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG.  With regards to the assessment of whether there are indications for a reversal of an impairment, in particular regarding the interpretation of a possible significant increase of the fair value, we evaluated management\u2019s assessment made on a quarterly and year-end basis as well as management\u2019s judgements and estimates contained therein and also considered external evidence on credit ratings, stock market prices, analysts' assessments and observable valuation indicatorsin this regard. In addition, we evaluated the calculation of the reversal of the impairment as of March 31, 2023."}, {"knowledge": "Independent Auditor\u2019s Reports (Group)    4  In order to assess the valuation of the investment in fiscal year 2023, we also considered the effects for Siemens AG from the acquisition of the shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. by Siemens Energy AG, the capital increase of Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. by Siemens AG.  Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the investment in Siemens Energy AG, and the reversal of the impairment, the effects of the other transactions described above as well as the events affecting Siemens Energy AG after the balance sheet date.  Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations regarding the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG as of September 30, 2023.  Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for investments in associates, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Details on the reversal of the impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG and the other described transactions are presented in Note 4 Interests in other entities. Regarding the subsequent events relating to the investment in Siemens Energy AG refer to Note 34 Subsequent events.  Provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations   Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We consider the accounting for provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, including allegations of corruption and antitrust violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.  Auditor\u2019s response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted are known and to assess management\u2019s estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Group entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.  We further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management\u2019s evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements is plausible.   Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.  Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for provisions, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, refer to Note 22 Legal proceedings.  Uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes  Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax legislation. The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities.  Auditor\u2019s response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of relevant local tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.   In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management\u2019s assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2023, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. In order to assess measurement and completeness, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management\u2019s assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.   In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management\u2019s assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income and compared them to internal business plans. In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries\u2019 retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning.  Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes."}, {"knowledge": "Independent Auditor\u2019s Reports (Group)    5  Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for income taxes, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to disclosures for deferred tax assets and liabilities, refer to Note 7 Income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.   In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information    \u2022 is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or   \u2022 otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.  Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report  Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as management has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.

It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, management is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.  Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group\u2019s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as management has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.  The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group\u2019s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.   Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group\u2019s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated"}, {"knowledge": "Independent Auditor\u2019s Reports (Group)    6  by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;  \u2022 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB;   \u2022 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.  We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.  We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management considers necessary to enable the preparation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure) or error.  The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in the EU Taxonomy disclosure. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation.

Notes to Annual Financial Statements  3.1 General Disclosures  Siemens AG has registered offices in Berlin and Munich, Germany. The Company is registered in the commercial register maintained by the local courts in Berlin Charlottenburg, Germany, under the entry number HRB 12300, and in Munich, Germany, under the entry number HRB 6684.  The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). Amounts are presented in millions of euros (\u20ac million). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided.  3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles  Revenue are proceeds from selling and leasing products, providing services and granting licenses, including licensing contracts for the use of the Siemens trademark.  Negative interest from financial investments is presented as a deduction in interest income, and positive interest from borrowings as a deduction in interest expenses.  Intangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalized at acquisition costs and amortized on a straight-line basis over a maximum of five years or, if longer, the contractually agreed useful life. Items are amortized on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. The capitalization option for internally generated intangible assets is not used.  Acquired goodwill is generally amortized systematically over the expected useful life of five to 15 years. The expected useful life is based on the expected use of the acquired businesses and is determined in particular by economic factors such as future growth and profit expectations, synergy effects and employee base.  Property, plant and equipment: The components of production costs are described in the context of the explanations for inventories. In general, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. In certain cases, the declining balance method is applied, whereby a switch is made from the declining balance to the straight-line method as soon as the latter results in higher depreciation expense. Items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. Low-value non-current assets that are subject to wear and tear, movable, and capable of being used independently, are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.  Useful lives of property, plant and equipment          Factory and office buildings 20 to 50 years  Other buildings 5 to 10 years  Technical equipment and machines  mostly 10 years  Other equipment, plant and office equipment 3 to 8 years  Equipment leased to others mostly 3 to 5 years       Special reserve with an equity portion includes reserves pursuant to Section 6b of the German Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz), recognized and transferred in fiscal years prior to the transition to regulations of the German Accounting Law Modernisation Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz).  Financial assets: Impairment losses are recognized if the decline in value is presumed to be other than temporary. This applies, if objective evidence, particularly events or changes in circumstances, indicate a significant or other than temporary decline in value. In case of an impairment in prior periods, a lower recognized value may not be maintained if the reasons for the impairment do no longer exist.  Inventories are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values. Production costs comprise, in addition to direct costs, an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. General administration expenses, expenses for social facilities, voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized. Write-downs are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of loss-free valuation of unbilled contracts in construction-type and service businesses.  Allowances on receivables are determined on the basis of the probability of default and country risks.  Deferred tax assets for differences between valuations of balance sheet line items in accordance to commercial and tax law and tax loss carryforwards are recognized if a future tax benefit is expected. Deferred tax assets are netted with deferred tax liabilities. Recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise temporary differences of assets, liabilities, and deferred items of entities forming part of the Siemens AG tax group and partnerships to the extent that the recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, or deferred items result in a deductible or taxable amount in the taxable profit (loss) of Siemens AG.  Offsetting of assets and of income and expenses: Siemens AG measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement (\u201cAltersteilzeit\u201d) arrangements and which cannot be accessed by other creditors.  Pensions and similar commitments: Siemens AG measures its pension obligations using the settlement amount calculated with the actuarial projected unit credit method on the basis of biometric probabilities. The discount rate used corresponds to the average market interest rate for instruments with an assumed remaining maturity of 15 years as published by German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank)."}, {"knowledge": "Annual Financial Statements  6  Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.  According to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung), Siemens AG is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle (mittelbarer Durchf\u00fchrungsweg). Siemens AG recognizes the underfunding in the item Provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension fund or of the pension and support fund (Pensions- und Unterst\u00fctzungskasse) do not cover the settlement amount of the respective pension obligations.  Other provisions are recognized in an appropriate and sufficient amount to cover individual obligations for all identifiable risks relating to liabilities of uncertain timing and amount and for anticipated losses on onerous contracts, taking account of price and cost increases expected to arise in the future. Provisions for agreed personnel restructuring measures were recognized for legal and constructive obligations. Significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds to the average market interest rate appropriate for the remaining term of the obligations, as calculated and published by Deutsche Bundesbank.  Foreign currency translation: Receivables, other current assets, securities, cash and cash equivalents, provisions and liabilities (excluding advance payments received on orders) as well as commitments and contingencies denominated in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Balance Sheet line items denominated in foreign currency which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-current assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date.  Guarantees and other commitments: Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees, i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and long-term investee companies or their parent companies. For measurement purposes, the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement, unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount (\u201crisk-adequate liability amount\u201d). Credit lines included in the guarantee obligations in the context of financing affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.  Derivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and \u2013 if the relevant conditions are met \u2013 are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created, changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part of the market value changes. The unrealized gains and losses from the effective part offset each other completely and are not recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement.  Classification of items in the annual financial statements: Siemens AG aggregates individual line items of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet if the individual line item is not material for providing a true and fair view of the Company\u2019s financial position and if such an aggregation improves the clarity of the presentation. Siemens AG discloses these items separately in the notes. 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement  NOTE 1 Revenue  Revenue by lines of business         Fiscal year  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023  Digital Industries 11,220  Smart Infrastructure 6,127  Other revenue 2,313  Revenue 19,660        Revenue by region          Fiscal year  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023  Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East 14,708  Americas 1,606  Asia, Australia 3,346  Revenue 19,660        NOTE 2 Other operating income and expenses  Other operating income included income from an intragroup service contract in the amount of \u20ac148 million.

Authorized capital  As of September 30, 2023, Siemens AG had authorized capital totaling a nominal amount of \u20ac600 million, which can be issued in instalments and with different time limits by issuing up to 200 million registered no-par value shares.  In detail, there are the following authorizations to increase the capital stock:  \u2022 By resolution of the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of February 3, 2021, the Managing Board is authorized to increase the capital stock until February 2, 2026 by up to \u20ac90 million through the issuance of up to 30 million Siemens shares against contributions in cash (Authorized Capital 2021). Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares may exclusively be offered to employees of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies (employee shares). To the extent permitted by law, employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.  \u2022 Further, by resolution of the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of January 30, 2019, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million registered no-par value shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019). Under certain conditions, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in the event of issue against contributions in kind. In the case of issue against cash payment, the shares are generally to be offered to shareholders for subscription. However, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights, firstly for any fractional amounts, secondly, to grant dilution compensation in connection with convertible bonds or bonds with warrants already issued, and thirdly, under certain further conditions, if the issue price of the new shares does not fall significantly below the stock exchange price of the Company's already listed shares.  Treasury shares  The following table presents the development of treasury shares:        Fiscal year  (in number of shares) 2023  Treasury shares, beginning of fiscal year  57,454,171  Retirement of treasury shares  (50,000,000)  Share buyback  6,853,091  Issuance under share-based payments and employee share programs  (4,227,344)  Treasury shares, end of fiscal year  10,079,918     Siemens AG held 10,079,918 treasury shares, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac30 million, representing 1.3% of the capital stock.  On June 24, 2021, Siemens announced a share buyback with a volume of up to \u20ac3 billion in the period from the beginning of fiscal 2022 to 2026. The share buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and will run no longer than until September 15, 2026, is executed based on the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 5, 2020. In addition to the dividend policy, the share buyback is intended to allow shareholders to continuously participate in the success of the Company. In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG repurchased a total of 6,853,091 treasury shares under this buyback program. This represented a nominal amount of \u20ac21 million or 0.9% of capital stock. In the current reporting period, \u20ac884 million (excluding incidental transaction charges) were spent for this purpose; this represents a weighted average stock price of \u20ac129.04 per share. The purchases were made in the reporting period on 248 Xetra trading days and were carried out by a bank that had been commissioned by Siemens AG; the shares were purchased exclusively on the electronic trading platform of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra). The average volume on these trading days was about 27,633 shares."}, {"knowledge": "Annual Financial Statements  12  The treasury shares purchased under the share buybacks may be used for purposes of retirement, distribution to employees, members of the executive bodies of companies affiliated with Siemens and members of the Managing Board, as well as the servicing of convertible bonds with attached warrants.  Following the 2023 Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, the Management Board resolved to redeem 50,000,000 treasury shares.  In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG re-issued in total 4,227,344 treasury shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with share-based payments and employee share programs in the Group, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac13 million and 0.5% of capital stock. The Company received in total \u20ac236 million for 1,843,831 shares, re-issued against payment of a purchase price. Siemens AG received this amount for unrestricted use. All shares were sold as investment shares in connection with the share matching program to plan participants. In each case, the purchase price was determined on the basis of the closing rate in Xetra trading, determined on a monthly effective date. Therefore, in the reporting period, in total 1,297,391 shares related to the monthly investment plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac138.69 per share, 227,427 shares related to the share matching plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac145.02 per share, and 319,013 shares related to the base share program at a weighted average share price of \u20ac72.51 per share (after consideration of a 50% subsidy by the Company). The other shares re-issued during the reporting period can be primarily attributed to the servicing of stock awards granted in fiscal 2019 totaling 1,693,126 shares, to 573,467 matching shares under the share matching program for fiscal 2020, and to 116,920 jubilee shares.

Disclosures on shareholdings of Siemens AG  As of September 30, 2023, the following information on shareholdings subject to reporting requirements was available to the Company pursuant to Section 160 para 1 No. 8 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz):  BlackRock, Inc., Wilmington, USA, informed us on August 7, 2023, that as of August 2, 2023, its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG amounted to 6.68% of which 6.56% were voting rights from 52,480,190 shares due to their participation and 0.12% were attributable to instruments.  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Wilmington, USA, informed us on December 22, 2022, that as of December 16, 2022, its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG amounted to 4.15% of which 0.28% were voting rights from 2,377,304 shares due to their participation and 3.87% were attributable to instruments.  The Werner Siemens-Stiftung, Zug, Switzerland, notified us on January 21, 2008, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on January 2, 2008 and amounted to 3.03% (27,739,285 voting rights) as per this date. NOTE 16 Provisions for pensions and similar commitments  In Germany, Siemens AG provides pension benefits through the BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation plans. The majority of Siemens\u2019 active employees participate in the BSAV. The benefits are predominantly based on nominal contributions by the Company and investment returns on assets designated to that plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the Company. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The pension benefits are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). A portion of these trust assets also covers the pension obligations of other domestic subsidiaries. Therefore, the assets do not meet the criteria for offsetting against the pension obligation and are presented as financial assets of Siemens AG.  The actuarial assumptions for valuation of the settlement amount as of September 30, 2023 were based, among others, on a discount rate of 1.81% and an average weighted pension increase of 2.40% p.a. The mortality tables used (Siemens Bio 2017/2023) are primarily based on data of the German Siemens population, using a set of formulas that corresponds to generally accepted actuarial standards. NOTE 17 Other provisions  The major amounts in other provisions were contributed by provisions related to personnel costs amounting to \u20ac1,136 million, provisions for contingent losses from derivative financial instruments amounting to \u20ac723 million, provisions for warranties, delay compensations, penalties for delay and breach of contract amounting to \u20ac639 million, provisions for decontamination obligations amounting to \u20ac489 million, and provisions related to guarantees and expected obligations from consortium agreements amounting to \u20ac267 million.  In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a public-law contract based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, with regard to conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility \u201cSchacht Konrad\u201d or a logistics depot until year-end 2032."}, {"knowledge": "Annual Financial Statements  13  NOTE 18 Liabilities                            thereof maturities    thereof maturities  (in million of \u20ac)  Sep 30, 2023  up to 1 year  1 year up to 5 years  more than 5 years  Sep 30, 2022  up to   1 year   1 year up to 5 years  more than 5 years  Liabilities to banks 339 2 337 \u2212 639 639 \u2212 \u2212  Trade payables 2,374 2,367 7 \u2212 2,249 2,209 40 \u2212  Liabilities to affiliated companies 59,483 54,165 3,732 1,585 63,946 56,143 6,119 1,684  Other liabilities 1,222 1,203 19 \u2212 1,080 1,019 61 \u2212  thereof to long-term investees 5 5 \u2212 \u2212 6 6 \u2212 \u2212  thereof miscellaneous liabilities 1,217 1,198 19 \u2212 1,074 1,013 61 \u2212  therein from taxes 111 111 \u2212 \u2212 93 93 \u2212 \u2212  therein for social security 91 91 \u2212 \u2212 137 137 \u2212 \u2212  Liabilities 63,417 57,737 4,095 1,585 67,914 60,010 6,220 1,684                Liabilities to affiliated companies resulted primarily from intragroup-financing activities. 3.5 Other disclosures  NOTE 19 Material expenses            Fiscal year  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022  Expenses for raw materials, supplies and purchased merchandise  (6,047) (5,541)  Costs of purchased services (4,210) (3,576)  Material expenses (10,257) (9,117)         NOTE 20 Personnel expenses            Fiscal year  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023 2022  Wages and salaries (4,767) (4,186)  Social security contributions and expenses for other employee benefits (689) (674)  Expenses for pensions (1,148) (1,213)  Personnel expenses (6,603) (6,073)          Personnel expenses did not include the expenses resulting from the compounding of the pension and personnel-related provisions, which are included in other financial income (expenses), net.

For the purpose of servicing share-based payment programs, Siemens AG also delivers Siemens shares, which have been granted by affiliated companies.  Stock Awards  Siemens AG grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees.   Stock awards to beneficiaries of Siemens AG are expensed as incurred over the vesting period and are measured at the intrinsic value (= share price of the Siemens stock) at the balance sheet date on a pro rata basis for the proportion of the vesting period expired, if applicable, considering the estimated target attainment at the balance sheet date."}, {"knowledge": "Annual Financial Statements  14  The following table shows the changes of stock awards subject to performance conditions held by beneficiaries of Siemens AG and, for the first time since fiscal 2023 due to the overall increase in volume, also stock awards not subject to performance conditions:       Fiscal year  (in number of shares) 2023  Non-vested, beginning of fiscal year 5,111,928  Granted 1,364,429  Vested and fulfilled (730,891)  Forfeited (924,465)  Settled (5,005)  Organizational changes (75,860)  Non-vested, end of fiscal year 4,740,136     The pro rata intrinsic value of all stock awards issued to beneficiaries of Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac343 million at the balance sheet date.  Share Matching Program   Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a vesting period.   Matching shares granted to beneficiaries of Siemens AG are expensed as incurred over the vesting period and are measured at the intrinsic value (= share price of the Siemens stock) at the balance sheet date on a pro rata basis for the proportion of the vesting period expired at the balance sheet date.

The items Obligations from guarantees and Warranty Obligations - Others included guarantees and other commitments for the benefit of companies of the Siemens Energy Group totaling \u20ac0.1 billion and \u20ac4.7 billion, respectively, with corresponding full reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG. In addition, the items included indemnifications issued in connection with dispositions of businesses. Such indemnifications, if customary to the relevant transactions, may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.  Warranty obligations included obligations of Siemens AG towards affiliated companies totaling \u20ac1.0 billion.  Siemens AG only enters into guarantees and other commitments after careful consideration of the risks concerned and in general only in relation to its own business activities or those of affiliated companies as well as to business activities of companies, if it holds an investment in them or their parent companies. Based on an ongoing risk evaluation of the arrangements entered into and taking into account all information available up to the date on which the Annual Financial Statements were issued for approval, Siemens AG concluded that the relevant primary debtors are able to fulfill the underlying obligations. For this reason, Siemens AG considered it not probable that it will be called upon in conjunction with any of the guarantees and commitments described above. NOTE 24 Financial payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements  Expenses for lease and rental arrangements in which the economic ownership of the leased/rented asset was not attributable to Siemens AG and the relevant items were not recognized as assets by Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac293 million. Object of these contracts were mainly real estate and other non-current assets.  Payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements amounted to \u20ac1,334 million, of which \u20ac201 million resulted from transactions with affiliated companies. Payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements due within the next fiscal year amounted to \u20ac247 million. NOTE 25 Other financial obligations  Approximately \u20ac1.5 billion were outstanding as of September 30, 2023, from an outsourcing agreement with a maturity of several years.  Obligations for equity contributions to affiliated companies amounted to \u20ac491 million.  Siemens AG has entered into a contract to pay its affiliated company Siemens Trademark GmbH & Co. KG, Germany, a running royalty for the use of the Siemens trademark rights. The fee is calculated by applying business-specific royalty rates to brand-related revenue. The contract has an indefinite duration. For fiscal 2023, the corresponding expenses amounted to \u20ac988 million. For fiscal 2024, the royalty is expected to be in the same magnitude.  In the course of its normal business operations, Siemens AG is involved in numerous legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (legal proceedings) in various jurisdictions. These legal proceedings could result in particular in the Company being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or criminal or civil sanctions, fines or disgorgements of profit. In individual cases, this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be expanded. Some of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens AG that may have material effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows in the respective reporting period. In addition, Siemens is jointly and severally liable within consortia. As far as not recognized in the financial statements, Siemens AG did not expect any material negative effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows at balance sheet date. NOTE 26 Derivative financial instruments and valuation units  As a consequence of its global operating, investing and financing activities, Siemens AG is in particular exposed to risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, managed in line with a proven risk management system in consideration of defined risk limits. As the parent company of the Siemens Group, Siemens AG has the central role within the group-wide management of financial market risks. To manage the risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Siemens AG uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps as well as combined interest and foreign currency swaps. Thereby the operating units of Siemens AG are not allowed to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The contract partners of the Company for derivative financial instruments are banks, brokers and affiliated companies. The credit rating for banks and brokers is constantly monitored.  The following table shows the notional volume and net fair values of existing derivative financial instruments that were not included in a valuation unit as of the balance sheet date:            Sep 30, 2023     (in millions of \u20ac)  Notional amount Fair values  Interest rate hedging contracts  8,038 (722)  Combined interest and currency hedging contracts 369 26  Existing derivative financial instruments 8,407 (696)       The notional amounts equal the contractual amounts of the individual derivative financial instrument which \u2013 irrespective of the nature of the concluded position (sale or purchase) \u2013 are presented on a gross basis (gross notional amounts).  Fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting expected future cash flows over the remaining term of the instrument using current market interest rates and yield curves."}, {"knowledge": "Annual Financial Statements  16  The following table shows the carrying amounts, if any, of derivative financial instruments that are not included in valuation units and the balance sheet items in which the carrying amounts are recognized:               Sep 30, 2023  (in millions of \u20ac) Other assets  Other provisions Other liabilities  Interest rate hedging contracts \u2212 (722) \u2212  Combined interest and currency hedging contracts \u2212 (1) \u2212  Derivative financial instruments requiring recognition \u2212 (723) \u2212        Provided the relevant conditions are met, derivative financial instruments are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. Using the freezing method, the hedging transactions are not recognized in the balance sheet. The effectiveness of the valuation unit is either ensured through risk management, or is demonstrated both prospectively and retrospectively based on appropriate methods used to demonstrate effectiveness (e.g. dollar offset method, regression method, sensitivity analysis). Valuation gains and losses from derivative financial instruments and hedged items are netted for each valuation unit. A provision for anticipated losses on onerous contracts is recognized for the respective valuation unit in the amount of an existing loss surplus. Profit surpluses are not recognized.  Valuation unit used to hedge the foreign currency risk   According to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.  The remaining foreign currency risk after offsetting cash flows in the same currency is hedged by the Corporate Treasury with external contract partners. The net foreign currency position (before hedging) is combined with the offsetting foreign currency exchange contracts to a macro valuation unit. For this purpose, hedged items and hedging instruments are measured with the respective underlying discounted cash flows. For foreign currency derivative financial instruments, the determination is based on the changes in relevant forward exchange rates. The existing derivative currency hedging contracts are included in the valuation unit in their entirety and had maturity terms until the year 2041. The cash in- and outflows from the foreign currency exchange contracts, firm commitments and forecast transactions are disclosed on a net basis in the following table.        Sep 30,  (in millions of \u20ac) 2023  Foreign currency risk from balance sheet items 3,115     thereof assets 14,073     thereof liabilities (10,958)  Foreign currency risk from firm commitments and forecast transactions 687     thereof expected cash inflows from firm commitments and forecast transactions 1,245     thereof expected cash outflows from firm commitments and forecast transactions (558)  Net foreign currency position (before hedging) 3,802  Foreign currency exchange contracts (net notional value) (3,968)     thereof with external contract partners 2,671     thereof with affiliated companies (6,639)  Net foreign currency position (after hedging) (166)         Firm commitments and forecast transactions relate to transactions for which a legally binding contract was concluded but not yet performed on by either contracting party, as well as contingent payment claims for already partially completed performance obligations in the project and product businesses.  As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of derivative financial instruments from foreign currency hedging transactions was \u20ac(4) million, net. Positive fair values of \u20ac1,897 million were offset by negative fair values of \u20ac1,901 million. For derivative financial instruments with negative fair values, no provision for anticipated losses was recognized as part of the valuation unit.  Valuation unit used to hedge the interest rate risk   The interest rate hedging contracts used by Siemens AG serve to reduce interest rate risks within the framework of an integrated asset-liability management approach and to optimize the interest results.  Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties to hedge interest rate swaps with its affiliated companies against interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate swaps with affiliated companies with a maximum maturity term until the year 2028 included in this macro-valuation unit had a notional amount of \u20ac2,121 million and fair values of \u20ac122 million. At balance sheet date, these underlying transactions were matched by external interest rate derivatives with negative fair values of \u20ac59 million, net, and a maximum maturity term until the year 2030.  To hedge interest rate risks arising from payables to affiliated companies, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties. As of September 30, 2023, the liabilities hedged in this micro-valuation unit had a nominal volume of \u20ac2,347 million and a maximum maturity term until the year 2025. As of September 30, 2023, the positive cumulative changes in the market value of these payables of \u20ac86 million were offset by external interest rate derivatives with identical maturities whose negative market value was \u20ac78 million."}, {"knowledge": "Annual Financial Statements  17  The amount of interest rate risks hedged with the valuation unit, which did not lead to a provision for anticipated losses, totaled \u20ac165 million. NOTE 27 Proposal for the appropriation of net income  The Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, amounting to \u20ac3,760 million to be appropriated as follows: Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac4.70 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend, and carry-forward of the unappropriated net income for shares of no par value not entitled to the dividend. NOTE 28 Remuneration of the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board  Remuneration of the members of the Managing Board   Members of the Managing Board received cash compensation of \u20ac18.8 million. The fair value of share-based compensation amounted to \u20ac10.5 million for 170,111 stock awards. The Company granted contributions under the BSAV to members of the Managing Board totaling \u20ac2.2 million.  Therefore, the compensation and benefits attributable to members of the Managing Board amounted to \u20ac31.6 million in total.  Total remuneration of former members of the Managing Board   Former members of the Managing Board and their surviving dependents received a total of \u20ac24.6 million according to Section 285 no. 9b of the German Commercial Code.  Siemens recognized pension provisions totaling \u20ac129.3 million for the pension entitlements to former members of the Managing Board and their surviving dependents.  Remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board   Compensation attributable to members of the Supervisory Board comprises a base compensation and additional compensation for committee work and amounted to \u20ac5.3 million (including meeting fees).

In addition, we have audited the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the group management report, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited chapter 11 \u201cEU Taxonomy disclosure\u201d of the combined management report, the sections \u201c8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM\u201d and \u201c8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)\u201d in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.

In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the management report does not cover chapter 11 \u201cEU Taxonomy disclosure\u201d of the combined management report, the sections \u201c8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM\u201d and \u201c8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)\u201d in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.   Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.  Basis for the opinions  We conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \u201cEU Audit Regulation\u201d) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). In conducting the audit of the annual financial statements we also complied with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the \u201cAuditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report\u201d section of our auditor\u2019s report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.  Key audit matters in the audit of the annual financial statements  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.   Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:  Valuation of non-current financial assets  Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The impairment test and the assessment regarding the need for a reversal of impairment of non-current financial assets was a key audit matter, as in particular shares in affiliated companies and investments entail a higher risk of material misstatement due to the materiality of these assets as well as the estimation uncertainties and judgments involved in assessing whether there is objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment or a reversal of impairment, and the determination of the fair values.  The determination of the fair values of non-current financial assets also depends to a large extent on the assessment of future cash inflows and the discount rate applied.   In case of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, in which 21,0% are held directly, the market capitalization during fiscal 2023 was on average above the book value sometimes significantly. As of September 30, 2023, a reversal of impairment to the stock market price has been recorded, following an impairment as of September 30, 2022.   Auditor\u2019s response: With regards to the net realizable values calculated by management and its assessment as to whether an impairment or reversal of impairment is expected to be permanent, we examined the underlying processes related to the planning of future cash flows"}, {"knowledge": "Independent Auditor\u2019s Report (Siemens AG)  3  as well as to the calculation of net realizable value, obtained an understanding of management\u2019s evaluation and also considered external evidence in this regard, amongst others, on the development of stock market prices.   We assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of the net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed the calculations with the assistance of internal valuation specialists. We further obtained explanations from management regarding material value drivers of the planning and examined whether the budget planning reflects general and industry-specific market expectations. Forecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budget-to-actual comparisons of historically forecast data with the actual results. The parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data. We also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions.  With regard to the reversal of impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we have traced the development of the stock market price and assessed the calculation of the reversal of impairment as of September 30, 2023, considering the acquisition costs of the investment.  Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the annual financial statements regarding the subsequent events relating to the investment in Siemens Energy AG.  Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of non-current financial assets as of September 30, 2023.  Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the impairment of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements and with respect to write-downs and write-ups of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement, Note 3 Income (loss) from investments, net as well as chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 10 Non-current assets and with respect to the subsequent events relating to the investment in Siemens Energy AG, refer to chapter 3.5 Other disclosures, Note 30 Subsequent events in the notes to the financial statements.  Other Provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations  Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for other provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations (legal proceedings) out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.  Auditor\u2019s response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted also in connection with joint and several liability are known and to assess management\u2019s estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Company entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the annual financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.   We further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management\u2019s evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the annual financial statements is plausible.   Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.  Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for other provisions, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements. With respect to the legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations, refer to chapter 3.5 Other Disclosures, Note 25 Other financial obligations.  Uncertain tax positions and recoverability of deferred tax assets  Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions as well as the recoverability of deferred tax assets.  Auditor\u2019s response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.   In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management\u2019s assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2023, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. In order to assess measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management\u2019s assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law."}, {"knowledge": "Independent Auditor\u2019s Report (Siemens AG)  4  In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management\u2019s assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income and compared them to internal business plans.   Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.   Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for income taxes, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles and chapter 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement, Note 6 Income taxes and with respect to disclosures for deferred tax assets, refer to chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 13 Deferred tax assets in the notes to the financial statements.  Other information  The Supervisory Board is responsible for the Report of the Supervisory Board in the Annual Report 2023 within the meaning of ISA [DE] 720 (Revised). Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the declaration pursuant to Sec. 161 AktG [\u201cAktiengesetz\u201d: German Stock Corporation Act] on the Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the Corporate Governance Statement, and for the Compensation Report. In all other respects, management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises chapter 11 \u201cEU Taxonomy disclosure\u201d of the combined management report, the sections \u201c8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM\u201d and \u201c8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)\u201d in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement. In addition, the other information comprises parts to be included in the Annual Report, of which we received a version prior to issuing this auditor\u2019s report, in particular:  \u2022 the Responsibility Statement (to the annual financial statements and the management report),  \u2022 the Responsibility Statement (to the consolidated financial statements and the group management report),  \u2022 the Five-Year Summary,  \u2022 the Compensation Report,  \u2022 the Report of the Supervisory Board,  \u2022 Notes and forward-looking statements,  but not the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements, not the disclosures of the combined management report whose content is audited and not our auditor\u2019s reports as well as not our auditor\u2019s report on a limited assurance engagement on the EU Taxonomy disclosure.  Our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.   In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information, and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information    \u2022 is materially inconsistent with the annual financial statements, with the management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or   \u2022 otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.   Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the annual financial statements and the management report  Management is responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as it, in accordance with German legally required accounting principles, has determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.  In preparing the annual financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, management is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.  Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Company\u2019s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as management has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.   The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report.  Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company\u2019s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the annual financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the"}, {"knowledge": "Independent Auditor\u2019s Report (Siemens AG)  5  audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements and this management report.  We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  \u2022 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual financial statements and of the management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for the risk of detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  \u2022 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the annual financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company;  \u2022 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures;   \u2022 conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;  \u2022 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the annual financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles;  \u2022 evaluate the consistency of the management report with the annual financial statements, its conformity with German law and the view of the Company\u2019s position it provides;  \u2022 perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.  We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.  We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.  From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.  Other legal and regulatory requirements  Report on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB  Opinion  We have performed assurance work in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report (hereinafter the \u201cESEF documents\u201d) contained in the file SIEMENS_2023.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format (\u201cESEF format\u201d).

Fiscal 2023 in retrospect  What did the economic and political environment look like at the start of fiscal 2023?  Siemens AG began fiscal 2023 spurred by a strong performance in fiscal 2022. However, the economic and political environment still contained a large number of uncertainties. Although new variants of the coronavirus did not produce the negative impacts feared and a crisis in gas and electricity supplies failed to materialize, the economic situation began to weaken \u2013 particularly in Germany, the Company\u2019s home market. The war in Ukraine continued as did tensions between the western democracies and China. On the other hand, supply chain pressures eased. Due to a sharp increase in inflation, all major central banks raised their interest rates to levels not seen since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. In Europe, high energy prices burdened economic development, while, in the U.S., consumption and the labor market in particular proved to be very resilient despite the interest rate increases. Growth in China \u2013 which had been strong following the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in Q1 of fiscal 2023 \u2013 slowed due to the normalization of inventories, which had built up during the pandemic, and as a result of the burdens imposed by the crisis in China\u2019s real estate market. Siemens AG\u2019s markets benefited from high order backlogs, positive price developments and customers\u2019 efforts to become more resilient, more competitive and more sustainable.   How is the strategy reflected in Managing Board compensation?  As a leading technology company, Siemens partners closely with other companies, industries and innovators in order to combine the real and the digital worlds. In this context, the Company focuses on accelerated, high-value growth. The Managing Board compensation determined by the Supervisory Board fosters the implementation of the Company\u2019s strategic targets by providing incentives for increasing profit, capital efficiency and cash generation. Incentives are also provided for driving the Company\u2018s digital transformation and developing its sustainability-related business.  In addition, sustainability \u2013 as a strategic goal and an expression of Siemens\u2019 social responsibility \u2013 is a high priority at Siemens. Sustainability is managed using the DEGREE framework. Introduced in fiscal 2021, this framework addresses sustainability from every angle and determines Siemens\u2019 ambitions in the sustainability area with systematized, measurable and specific long-term targets for environment, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. DEGREE is an acronym that stands for decarbonization, ethics, governance, resource efficiency, equity and employability. The DEGREE framework is continuously developed and adapted to the commitments that Siemens has made, such as the Science Based Targets initiative. The key performance indicators applied in long-term variable compensation are part of this DEGREE framework (CO2 emissions and digital learning hours per employee) and/or reflect the Company\u2019s priorities (Net Promoter Score as an expression of customer satisfaction).  How did Siemens perform in fiscal 2023?  Fiscal 2023 was another very successful year for Siemens. We achieved excellent financial results in a volatile market environment, which on the one hand included destocking by customers and distributors following previously proactive purchasing, particularly in our short-cycle businesses, and on the other hand included improved supply chain conditions, which accelerated revenue conversion from our high order backlog. We raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the first and the second quarters. We then reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2023.   Revenue was higher in nearly all our industrial businesses and rose to \u20ac77.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries contributed double-digit growth with all businesses posting increases. Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens rose 11%. Profit Industrial Business exceeded the record high of a year earlier and rose 11% to \u20ac11.4 billion. The profit margin of our Industrial Business rose to 15.4%, up from 15.1% a year earlier, reaching its highest level ever.   Net income nearly doubled year-over year to a historic high of \u20ac8.5 billion and corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled to \u20ac10.04. Earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA) increased to \u20ac10.77.   Return on capital employed (ROCE) for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022. This increase was due to sharply higher income before interest after tax year-over-year. We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE, which was to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.   Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 was \u20ac10.0 billion, reaching a record high. The cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net"}, {"knowledge": "Compensation Report \u2192 A. Fiscal 2023 in retrospect  income, was 1.17. We thus achieved a cash conversion rate that contributed strongly to the average required to reach our target of 1 minus annual comparable revenue growth rate over a cycle of three to five years.  Siemens\u2019 strong operating performance in fiscal 2023 is reflected in the Managing Board\u2019s variable compensation, which takes into account not only financial success but also environmental and social aspects. As a result, the compensation of the Managing Board members is also oriented toward the interests of the shareholders as well as the other stakeholders of Siemens AG.  Composition of the Managing Board and the Compensation Committee  There were no changes in the composition of the Managing Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2023, the Managing Board comprised Dr. Roland Busch (President and CEO), Cedrik Neike, Matthias Rebellius, Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas and Judith Wiese.  Following the scheduled departure of Michael Diekmann, the previous Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG, from the Supervisory Board and thus also from the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee elected Matthias Zachert to serve as its new Chairman, effective February 10, 2023. Grazia Vittadini has been a new member of the Compensation Committee since February 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Compensation Committee comprised Matthias Zachert (Chairman), Harald Kern, J\u00fcrgen Kerner, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Birgit Steinborn and Grazia Vittadini.  Vote on the Compensation Report for fiscal 2022 at the 2023 Annual Shareholders\u2018 Meeting  The Compensation Report for fiscal 2022 was prepared in accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and its content was also audited by the independent auditors, beyond the requirement of Section 162 para. 3 sent. 1 and 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Compensation Report on the compensation individually awarded and due to the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2022 was approved by a majority of 92.09% of the valid votes cast at the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 9, 2023.  In view of the high level of approval, the Compensation Report for 2023 is basically unchanged in structure and scope. In addition, no changes to the compensation system were deemed necessary for fiscal 2023. Pursuant to Section 120a para.1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the compensation system for Managing Board members must be submitted for regular approval by the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting in February 2024. In this connection, the compensation system has been subjected to a comprehensive review and adjusted.

Compensation of Managing Board members  B. Compensation of Managing Board members  B.1 The compensation system at a glance  The compensation system for the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG that is applicable for fiscal 2023 has been in place since fiscal 2020 and was approved by the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 5, 2020, by a majority of 94.51% of the valid votes cast.  The compensation of the Managing Board members consists of fixed and variable components. Fixed compensation, which is not performance-based, comprises base salary, fringe benefits and a pension benefit commitment. Short-term variable compensation (Bonus) and long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) are performance-based compensation and thus variable.  The Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key component of the compensation system. They obligate Managing Board members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined amount.  The Managing Board compensation system is also supplemented by commitments granted in connection with the commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of work.

Compensation of Managing Board members  B.2 Principles of the determination of compensation  B.2.1 Target compensation and compensation structure  The Supervisory Board has determined, in accordance with the compensation system for the Managing Board members, the amount of each Managing Board member\u2019s total target compensation for fiscal 2023. In making this determination, the Supervisory Board has ensured that the proportion of long-term variable compensation always exceeds that of short-term variable compensation and that the proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components are within the ranges defined in the compensation system.    The regular review of Managing Board compensation at the beginning of fiscal 2023 in order to determine the compensation\u2019s appropriateness and conformity with customary market practices indicated that \u2013 when compared to the companies in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, that have been defined in the compensation system as the relevant market \u2013 the total target compensation of the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG was positioned toward the lower end of the customary market ranges. Compared to the companies in the STOXX Europe 50, which is also used for a market comparison due to Siemens\u2019 international footprint, direct target compensation was actually below the customary market range. Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board approved an increase in the total target compensation of all Managing Board members as of October 1, 2022. This increase was implemented by raising the individual members\u2019 Stock Awards target amounts. The Stock Awards target amount for Dr. Roland Busch was raised to \u20ac3,340,000 from \u20ac2,954,000, the target amount for Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas was raised to \u20ac2,145,000 from \u20ac2,000,000, the target amount for Cedrik Neike was raised to \u20ac1,470,000 from \u20ac1,259,000, and the target amounts for the remaining Managing Board members were raised to \u20ac1,380,000 from \u20ac1,259,000.   Due to the increase in the Stock Awards target amounts, variable compensation is structured on a more long-term basis, while compensation as a whole is oriented even more toward sustainable Company development.  Regarding compensation, all components of the compensation of the position of President and CEO are differentiated. The target amount of Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas\u2019s Stock Awards is differentiated due to his particular responsibilities as CFO. The target amount of Cedrik Neike\u2019s Stock Awards is also differentiated due to the outstanding business results of Digital Industries, the strategic importance of this Business for the further development of Siemens AG and Cedrik Neike\u2019s five-years of membership on the Managing Board.

For this purpose, the Supervisory Board assessed the compensation\u2019s level and structure relative to the companies included in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, and relative to the companies included in the STOXX Europe 50 (horizontal comparison). In the course of its review, the Supervisory Board also assessed the development of Managing Board compensation relative to the compensation of Senior Management and Siemens\u2019 total workforce in Germany (vertical comparison).

The total workforce comprises Senior Management as well as the Siemens employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements and those who are not.

Compensation of Managing Board members  B.3 Variable compensation in fiscal 2023  Variable compensation is tied to performance and accounts for a significant proportion of the total compensation of Managing Board members. It consists of a short-term variable component (Bonus) and a long-term variable component (Stock Awards).  The performance criteria and the key performance indicators used to measure performance for variable compensation in fiscal 2023 are derived from the Company\u2019s strategic goals and operational steering and are in line with the compensation system applicable for fiscal 2023. As a rule, all the performance criteria measure successful value creation in all its different forms, as strategically envisioned. In line with Siemens\u2019 social responsibility, sustainability is also included in the performance criteria.  The performance criteria relevant for fiscal 2023, the key performance indicators, the focus topics and the explanations of how these foster the Company\u2019s long-term development are shown in the following table.  Performance criteria of variable compensation and link to strategy    Performance  criterion  Key performance indicator / focus topic Bonus  Stock Awards Link to strategy   Profit Earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA)  \uf050   EPS reflects the net income attributable to the shareholders of Siemens AG and incentivizes the sustainable increase in profit \u2013 particularly by focusing on profitable growth. This key performance indicator provides a comprehensive perspective that encompasses all units of the Siemens Group. The consideration of EPS pre PPA strengthens the focus on Siemens\u2019 operating performance.  Profitability / capital efficiency  Return on capital employed adjusted  (ROCE adjusted)  \uf050   ROCE, which is the primary measure for managing capital efficiency at Group level, reflects our focus on profitable growth, the implementation of measures to sustainably increase competitiveness and stringent working capital management. The adjustment of ROCE places the focus on Siemens\u2019 operating performance.  Liquidity Cash conversion rate (CCR) \uf050   CCR measures the ability to convert profit into cash flow in order to finance growth and offer our shareholders an attractive, progressive dividend policy.  Growth Comparable revenue growth \uf050   Further accelerating high-value growth is a key element of Siemens\u2019 strategy. As a leading technology company, Siemens wants to expand its position on all targeted markets and tap additional profitable markets.  Long-term value creation  Total shareholder return (TSR)  \uf050  TSR is a yardstick for measuring the achievement of Siemens\u2019 strategic goal of sustainably increasing Company value. It indicates total value creation for shareholders in the form of increases in the Siemens share price and dividends paid.   Execution of Company strategy  Various focus topics  \uf050   The individual targets for executing the Company strategy enable the Company to focus on specific factors that are aligned with its short- and medium-term targets and measures in order to ensure its long-term strategic development.

The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the basis of key performance indicators. Within the \u201cIndividual targets\u201d dimension, the financial performance criteria \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201cliquidity\u201d can be employed as can additional, non-financial performance criteria. In the case of non-financial performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so-called focus topics, which comprise operations-related aspects of the execution of the Company\u2019s strategy as well as sustainability-related aspects.  At the end of the fiscal year, target achievement for the individual key performance indicators and the achievement of the Managing Board members\u2019 individual targets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average. The percentage of weighted target achievement multiplied by the individual target amount yields the Bonus payout amount for the past fiscal year. The payable Bonus is capped at two times the target amount and is paid in cash, at the latest, together with the compensation paid at the end of February of the following fiscal year.    \u201cSiemens Group\u201d target dimension  For the \u201cSiemens Group\u201d target dimension in fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG defined the performance criterion \u201cprofit.\u201d In accordance with external communications and the Siemens Financial Framework for the financial steering of the Company, the focus is on the transparent presentation of Siemens\u2019 operating performance. For this reason, \u201cprofit\u201d is measured in terms of basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA). EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. It includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG.  To take account of the Company\u2019s long-term performance and provide incentives for a sustainable increase in profit, the average EPS pre PPA of three consecutive fiscal years was used for target setting. The portfolio of Siemens AG changed significantly due to the spin-off of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal 2020. Against this backdrop, target setting for fiscal 2023 was defined on the basis of comparable EPS pre PPA values. The following EPS pre PPA values were used for this purpose: the EPS pre PPA value of continuing operations was used for fiscal 2020, and the EPS pre PPA values of continuing and discontinued operations were used for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.

ROCE is defined as profit before interest and after tax divided by average capital employed. For the purposes of target setting and determining target achievement, ROCE \u2013 as defined in the Siemens Financial Framework, which excludes certain Varian-related acquisition effects \u2013 is adjusted for main effects relating to the stake in Siemens Energy (profit \u201cSiemens Energy Investment\u201d in the numerator and asset \u201cSiemens Energy Investment\u201d in the denominator).

CCR Siemens Group is defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net income. For the Managing Board members with business responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, the CCR targets are business-specific and defined as the ratio of free cash flow to profit at each business. The target amounts for CCR were based on the budget plans.

Compensation of Managing Board members  Total target achievement for the Bonus for fiscal 2023  Total target achievement and the resulting Bonus payout amount for each Managing Board member are summarized in the following table.   B.3.2 Long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards)  Siemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. A Stock Award is the claim to one share \u2013 conditional on target achievement \u2013 after the expiration of a defined vesting period. The vesting period is, accordingly, the term of each Stock Awards tranche.  At the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on 100% target achievement for each Managing Board member. This target amount is extrapolated to target achievement of 200% (\u201cmaximum allocation amount\u201d). Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the estimated discounted dividends (\u201callocation price\u201d).  An approximately four-year vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.  Performance criteria  Since fiscal 2020, the number of Siemens shares that is actually transferred depends 80% on the financial performance criterion \u201clong-term value creation,\u201d measured on the basis of the key performance indicator \u201ctotal shareholder return\u201d (TSR), and 20% on the non-financial performance criterion \u201csustainability.\u201d For measuring the \u201csustainability\u201d performance criterion, Siemens AG\u2019s performance in the environment, social and governance (ESG) area is assessed on the basis of a Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index, the composition of which is determined annually by the Supervisory Board.  Total shareholder return \u2013 TSR is indicative of the performance of one share over a specified period of time \u2013 in the case of Siemens, over the approximately four-year vesting period. It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends paid during this period. To reflect the Company\u2019s international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index.  Target achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the end-of-month values over the first 12 months of the vesting period (reference period).  In order to determine at the end of the vesting period how well the TSR of Siemens AG has performed relative to the TSR of the sector index, the TSR performance value is calculated over the subsequent 36 months (performance period). The TSR performance value is the average of the end-of-month values during the performance period.

The following applies for the determination of target achievement.    Environment, social and governance \u2013 The Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is based on three equally weighted, structured and verifiable ESG key performance indicators. At the beginning of each tranche, the Supervisory Board defines the target values for each of the ESG key performance indicators. Target measurement is based on defined interim targets for each fiscal year. Target achievement for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is finally determined at the end of the approximately four-year vesting period on the basis of the weighted average of the target achievement values calculated for each of the key performance indicators.  Determination of total target achievement  At the end of the approximately four-year vesting period, the Supervisory Board determines the degree of target achievement. The target achievement range for TSR and for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is between 0% and 200%. If target achievement is less than 200%, a number of Siemens Stock Awards equivalent to the shortfall are forfeited without refund or replacement and a correspondingly smaller number of shares is transferred.  The value of the Siemens shares transferred after the expiration of the vesting period is also capped at 300% of the target amount.

The 2019 Stock Awards tranche depended on the performance of the Siemens share compared to the share performance of five relevant competitors during the approximately four-year vesting period from November 9, 2018, to November 17, 2022.    The following table provides a summary of the key parameters of the 2019 Stock Awards tranche. In connection with the due date and settlement of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2019, the table also includes an additional cash payment to the Managing Board members as a result of the Siemens Energy spin-off. The spin-off of Siemens Energy in fiscal 2020 led to adjustments in the stock-based compensation commitments agreed upon until the spin-off date. At the time when the 2019 Stock Awards became due, the Managing Board members \u2013 like all other eligible employees \u2013 were, accordingly, entitled to receive an additional cash payment based on the spin-off ratio of 2:1 and on the Siemens Energy share price of \u20ac14.68 on the date when their stock-based compensation commitments became due.

For this reason, the number of Stock Awards, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of 200%. At the end of the vesting period, a final number of Siemens shares to be transferred will be determined on the basis of actual target achievement and taking into account the Stock Awards cap.  2 The target achievement of the Stock Awards from the 2019 tranche, which were due and settled in fiscal 2023, was 91%. Since the Stock Awards were initially allocated on the basis of 200% target achievement, a number equivalent to this shortfall was forfeited without refund or replacement, in accordance with plan requirements.  3 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019. The reported figures include the Stock Awards allocated to Cedrik Neike by Siemens Ltd. China due to this position.  4 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is CEO of Smart Infrastructure and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG.  The corresponding legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. The Stock Awards reported here also include the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Schweiz AG since the appointment of Matthias Rebellius to the Managing Board of Siemens AG.  5 The reported figures also include the Stock Awards allocated to Judith Wiese in November 2020 as compensation for the loss of benefits granted by her former employer in addition to the regular allocation of Stock Awards from the 2021 tranche."}, {"knowledge": "Compensation Report \u2192 B.

Compensation of Supervisory Board members  C. Compensation of Supervisory Board members  The currently applicable rules for Supervisory Board compensation are set out in Section 17 of the Articles of Association of Siemens AG. They have been in effect since October 1, 2021, and stem from a decision of the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 3, 2021, in accordance with Section 113 para. 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The compensation system for Supervisory Board members submitted to the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting and the proposed new version of Section 17 of the Articles of Association were approved by a majority of 97.49% of the valid votes cast. The compensation system approved by the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting as well as the Articles of Association are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE.  Supervisory Board compensation consists entirely of fixed compensation; it reflects the responsibilities and scope of the work of the Supervisory Board members. Under the applicable rules, the members of the Supervisory Board receive base compensation for each full fiscal year, and the members of the Audit Committee, the Chairman\u2019s Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation for their committee work. The Chairman and Deputy Chairs of the Supervisory Board as well as the chairs of the Audit Committee, the Chairman\u2019s Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation.    In the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board and/or its committees within a fiscal year, compensation is paid on a pro-rated basis, rounding up to the next full month.   In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board receive a fee of \u20ac2,000 for each of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees that they attend. Attendance at a meeting also includes participation via telephone, video conference or other similar customary means of communication. For attendance at several meetings on the same day, only a single fee is paid.  The members of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their duties and for any value-added tax to be paid on their compensation. For the performance of his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is also entitled to an office with secretarial support and the use of a car service. No loans or advances from the Company are provided to members of the Supervisory Board.

Comparative information on profit development and annual change in compensation  D. Comparative information on profit development and annual change in compensation  The following table shows, in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), Siemens\u2019 profit development, the annual change in the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members\u2019 compensation and the annual change in average employee compensation on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five fiscal years.  Profit development is presented on the basis of the Siemens Group\u2019s key performance indicators revenue, comparable revenue growth and basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations. Through fiscal 2021, the latter was also one of the financial targets for the short-term variable compensation (Bonus) of the Managing Board and thus had a significant influence on the amount of the compensation of the Managing Board members. Since fiscal 2022, the comparative information has also included basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation. This key performance indicator supersedes basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations in the Bonus in accordance with the Siemens Financial Framework, which has been in effect since fiscal 2022. In accordance with Section 275 para. 3 No. 16 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB), the development of the net income of Siemens AG is also shown.  The compensation awarded and due to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members in each fiscal year is presented in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Pension payments to former members of the Managing Board are not listed here since they do not depend on Siemens\u2018 profit development.  The presentation of average employee compensation is based on the size of the workforce, including trainees, employed by Siemens in Germany. In fiscal 2023, this workforce comprised on average 70,984 employees (full-time equivalent). By way of comparison, the Siemens Group had about 254,000 employees and trainees worldwide as of September 30, 2023. The figures exclude the workforce of Siemens Healthineers, which is not included in the presentation since it is a separately managed, publicly listed company.  Average employee compensation comprises the personnel costs for wages and salaries, fringe benefits, employer contributions to social insurance and any short-term variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year. For compensation in connection with share plans, the amounts received in the fiscal year are taken into account. Therefore, employee compensation is also equivalent, in principle, to awarded and due compensation within the meaning of Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and is thus in line with Managing Board and Supervisory Board compensation."}, {"knowledge": "Compensation Report \u2192 D.

Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board Management and the Supervisory Board of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 162 AktG. In addition, management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.  Auditor\u2019s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Compensation Report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Compensation Report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the Compensation Report and the related disclosures. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures.  We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  Opinion In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the Compensation Report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions of Sec. 162 AktG.

The Company\u2019s long-range strategy of  combining  the real and the digital worlds and its rigorous orien- tation toward long-term growth fields paid off: Siemens  benefited from strong, stable developments in the global  markets \u2013 above all, from worldwide efforts to make  value chains across the board more efficient, resilient  and sustainable. The Company also made major invest- ments to drive its innovative power and enhance its  manufacturing capacities \u2013 while further strengthening  its regional diversification.  Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board focused  intensively in fiscal 2023 on the execution of Siemens\u2019  growth strategy. Siemens Xcelerator, our open digital  business platform, gained more and more momentum  and is the key element of Siemens\u2019 strategy to combine  the real and the digital worlds. The business opportunities  created by  digitalization and sustainability as well as the  DEGREE sustainability framework were likewise priorities.  In  addition, the elections at the 2023 Annual Shareholders\u2019  Meeting enabled the Supervisory Board to successfully  further develop its own profile of skills and expertise,  particularly in the areas of technology and sustainability.  Today, our Supervisory Board is more global and more  diverse than ever before \u2013 and, as a result, excellently  positioned to optimally support the Company also in the  next phases of its development.  In fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board performed in full  the duties assigned to it by law, the Siemens Articles  of Association and the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board.  On the basis of detailed written and oral reports provided  by the Managing Board, we monitored the Managing  Board and advised it on the management of the Company.  In my capacity as Chairman of the Super visory Board,  I regularly exchanged information with the  President and  Chief Executive Officer and other Managing Board mem- bers. As a result, the Supervisory Board was always  kept up to date on projected business policies, Company   planning \u2013 including financial, investment and personnel  planning \u2013 and the Company\u2019s profitability and business  operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the  Siemens Group. We were directly involved at an early  stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the  Company and discussed these decisions with the Man- aging Board intensively and in detail. To the extent that  Supervisory Board approval of the decisions and mea- sures of Company management was required by law, the  Siemens Articles of Association or our Bylaws, the mem- bers of the Supervisory Board \u2013 prepared in some cases  by the Supervisory Board\u2019s committees \u2013 issued such  approval after intensive review and discussion. A special focus of our activities in fiscal 2023 was the fur- ther implementation of the Company\u2019s growth strategy.  At our meetings and in additional informational sessions,  we concerned ourselves intensively with the goals and  priorities of Siemens\u2019 businesses and with the Managing  Board\u2019s technology and personnel strategy. In this connec- tion, we focused our attention on the accelerated trans- formation toward digitalization and sustainability and on  business and technological innovation and the related  opportunities for growth. Together with the Managing  Board, we discussed markets, trends and growth fields. A  further focus of our activities in fiscal 2023 \u2013 in addition to  Siemens Xcelerator, our platform for driving the digital  transformation \u2013 was Siemens AG\u2019s sustainability  strategy.  We focused on s ustainability-related topics in the environ- ment, social and governance (ESG) area. At the center was  not only DEGREE, our Companywide sustainability frame- work \u2013 with the aspects of decarbonization, ethics, gover- nance, resource efficiency, equity and employability \u2013 but  also the positive impact the Company creates for customers  with its port folio. The Supervisory Board discussed the risks  and opportunities for the Company connected with social  and environmental factors as well as the environmental  and social impact of the Company\u2019s activities. The discus- sion made clear that sustainability is a strategic business  opportunity for Siemens due to our strong portfolio focused"}, {"knowledge": "Report of the Supervisory Board on decarbonization and energy efficiency, resource effi- ciency and circularity as well as people  centricity and social  impact. The Supervisory Board discussed the risks and op- portunities for the Company connected with social and en- vironmental factors as well as the environmental and social  impact of the Company\u2019s activities. The Supervisory Board  also concerned itself with the 2022 Sustainability Report. Topics at the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board We held a total of six regular plenary meetings in fiscal  2023. We also held an extraordinary constituent meeting  of the Supervisory Board immediately after the Annual  Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 9, 2023. Six meetings  were held in person and one in a so-called hybrid format \u2013  that is, as an in-person meeting with the possibility of   virtual participation. No meetings were held via telephone  conference or in an exclusively virtual format. We also  made one decision using other customary forms of com- munication. Topics of discussion at our regular plenary  meetings were strategic progress, revenue, profit and em- ployment development at Siemens AG and the Siemens  Group, the Company\u2019s financial position and the results of  its operations, personnel-related matters, the status of the  implementation of Siemens Xcelerator, and sustainability.  In addition, we concerned ourselves, as occasion required,  with acquisition and divestment projects and with risks to  the Company. The Supervisory Board and/or the Innovation  and Finance Committee were regularly informed \u2013 within  the stipulated legal framework \u2013 by the relevant Managing  Board member about measures and decisions of funda- mental importance at the Equity Investments, companies  in which Siemens holds a majority stake. In addition, we  regularly met in sessions without the Managing Board in  attendance. In these closed sessions, we dealt with agenda  items that concerned either the Managing Board itself or  internal Supervisory Board matters. At our meeting on November 16, 2022, the Managing  Board reported to us on the Company\u2019s current business  position, including personnel-related matters and   sustainability, as of the fourth quarter. We discussed the  key financial figures for fiscal 2022 and approved the  budget for fiscal 2023. We also discussed the Managing  Board\u2019s considerations regarding business activities at  Large Drive Applications. On a recommendation by the  Compensation Committee, we also determined the   Managing Board members\u2019 compensation for fiscal 2022  on the basis of calculated target achievement. A review  conducted by an independent compensation expert con- firmed the appropriateness of this compensation. We  had already defined the performance criteria for the Man- aging Board\u2019s variable compensation for fiscal 2023 at our  meeting on September 23, 2022. On this basis and on a  recommendation by the Compensation Committee, we  made a decision regarding target setting for Managing  Board compensation for fiscal 2023 at our meeting on   November 16, 2022. At this meeting, we also  approved  the Corporate Governance Statement for  fiscal 2022 and  endorsed a decision by the Managing Board regarding   financing measures. In addition, we concerned ourselves  with personnel-related matters regarding the Managing  Board and, on a recommendation by the Chairman\u2019s Com- mittee, approved the extension of Judith Wiese\u2019s appoint- ment as a full member of the Managing Board from   October 1, 2023, until the end of September 30, 2028. On December 7, 2022, we discussed the 2022 Annual   Financial Report \u2013 comprising the financial statements  and the Combined Management Report for Siemens AG  and the Siemens Group as of September 30, 2022 \u2013 as  well as the Report of the Supervisory Board to the  Annual  Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, the Sustainability Report, the  Compensation Report for fiscal 2022, the Report on Gen- der Equality and Equal Pay in accordance with the German  Transparency in Wage Structures Act (Entgelttranspa renz\u00ad gesetz, EntgTranspG) and the agenda for the ordinary  Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 9, 2023. On  the basis of recommendations by the Nomi nating Com- mittee, we concerned ourselves with proposals regarding  the election of seven shareholder representatives on the  Supervisory Board at the 2023 Annual Shareholders\u2019  Meeting. We also concerned ourselves with the annual  reporting by the Chief Compliance  Officer and the Global  Chief Cypersecurity Officer. One focus of the meeting was  the Company\u2019s personnel  strategy. The Managing Board  reported on measures  regarding employee training and  development under the heading #NextWork, with the aim  of systematically addressing the megatrends digitaliza- tion, automation and demographic change. On January 31, 2023, we approved \u2013 in a decision using other  customary means of communication \u2013 a decision regarding  the exercise of shareholding rights in associated companies  of Siemens AG pursuant to Section 32 of the German Code- termination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz, MitbestG). At our meeting on February 8, 2023, the Managing  Board reported on the Company\u2019s current business and  financial position, including personnel-related matters"}, {"knowledge": "Report of the Supervisory Board and sustainability, as of the first quarter. We were in- formed about the current business position of Siemens  Healthineers and that of its Diagnostics Business Area, in  particular. Due to the regular election of ten employee representa- tives and seven shareholder representatives on the   Supervisory Board, a constituent meeting of the Super- visory Board was held immediately after the Annual  Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on February 9, 2023. At this meet- ing, the Supervisory Board confirmed Birgit  Steinborn  as the Supervisory Board\u2019s First Deputy Chairwoman and  Dr. Werner Brandt as the Supervisory Board\u2019s Second  Deputy Chairman, effective the beginning of their re- spective new electoral periods. The Supervisory Board  also elected the members of its committees. At the beginning of May 2023, the members of the   Managing and Supervisory Boards met several times in  smaller groups (so-called multilateral strategy sessions)  to consider and discuss in detail topics of strategic   importance to the Company. At our meeting on May 16, 2023, the Managing Board  reported on the Company\u2019s current business and finan- cial position, including personnel-related matters and  sustainability, as of the second quarter. As part of a stra- tegic focus, we concerned ourselves at this meeting \u2013 on  the basis of the strategy discussions held in the previous  weeks in smaller groups with the Managing Board \u2013 ex- tensively and in detail with the growth targets and the  further implementation of Siemens\u2019 strategy as a focused  technology company.

We were also informed  about the current business position of Siemens Healthi- neers and about progress in the integration of Varian. We  approved amendments to the Bylaws for the Managing  Board, for the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman\u2019s  Committee, the Audit Committee, the Innovation and  Finance Committee, and the Compensation Committee  of the Supervisory Board. At our meeting on August 9, 2023, the Managing Board  reported on the Company\u2019s current business and finan- cial position and on personnel-related matters as of the  third quarter. One focus of the meeting was the   Company\u2019s sustainability strategy. We concerned our- selves with the Company\u2019s strategic orientation and with  progress in its sustainability-related transformation. We  discussed the Company\u2019s business opportunities con- nected with sustainability-related factors and concerned  ourselves with business potential particularly in the ar- eas of decarbonization, energy efficiency and resource  efficiency. Regulatory requirements \u2013 in particular, the  EU taxonomy and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting  Directive (CSRD) \u2013 and their impact on Siemens were  also topics of our discussions. In addition, we discussed  the Siemens Energy investment and the format of the  2024 Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. Finally, we dealt  with Managing Board compensation and approved a pro- posal regarding the engagement of the auditors of the  Compensation Report for fiscal 2023.  The Supervisory Board meeting on September 22, 2023,  was held in Berlin, where we gained an insight into the  future-oriented project Siemensstadt Square and, on a tour  of the R\u00f6hrenwerk tube plant, familiarized ourselves with  the advanced production and manufacturing methods at  the long-standing location. At the meeting, the Managing  Board reported on the state of the Company. The person- nel strategy of Siemens AG was again a focus of the meet- ing. Following up on its reporting on December 7, 2022,  the Managing Board informed us about the strategic   approach to systematic workforce training, which aimed  to drive the organization\u2019s transformation and empower  its employees to continuously learn and grow. We dis- cussed the Managing Board\u2019s considerations regarding the  2024 budget. A further focus of the meeting was Manag- ing Board compensation, whose appropriateness had  been confirmed by an internal review. After preparation by  and on a recommendation of the Compensation Commit- tee, we approved an adjustment of the compensation   system for the Managing Board as of fiscal 2024. As part of  the annual review of Managing Board compensation and  after preparation by and on a recommendation of the  Compensation Committee, we determined each Manag- ing Board member\u2019s individual total target compensation  and maximum compensation and defined the perfor- mance criteria for variable compensation for fiscal 2024. In  addition, we dealt with matters relating to corporate gov- ernance \u2013 in particular, the Declaration of Conformity with  the German Corporate Governance Code. We approved  amendments to the  Bylaws for the Managing Board and  changes to the  diversity concept for the Managing Board.  We also concerned ourselves with the independence of"}, {"knowledge": "Report of the Supervisory Board the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board  within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance  Code and with the Supervisory Board\u2019s qualification   matrix.

Work in the Supervisory Board committees In fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board had six standing  committees. These committees prepare decisions and  topics to be dealt with at the Supervisory Board\u2019s plenary  meetings. Some of the Supervisory Board\u2019s decision-mak- ing powers have been delegated to these committees  within the permissible legal framework. The committee  chairpersons report to the Supervisory Board on their  committees\u2019 work at the subsequent Board meeting. A  list of the members and a detailed explanation of the  tasks of the individual Supervisory Board committees are  set out in the Corporate Governance Statement. The Chairman\u2019s Committee met eight times. Three  meetings were held in person, two in a virtual format via  video conference and three in a so-called hybrid format.  The Chairman\u2019s Committee also made one decision using  other customary means of communication. In my capac- ity as Chairman of the Chairman\u2019s Committee, I discussed  topics of major importance with other Committee mem- bers also between meetings. The Committee concerned  itself, in particular, with personnel-related matters, long- term succession planning for the composition of the  Managing Board, corporate governance issues and the  acceptance by Managing Board members of positions at  other companies and institutions. The Nominating Committee met three times. Two meet- ings were held in a virtual format via video conference  and one in a so-called hybrid format. The Nominating  Committee gave in-depth consideration to succession  planning for the composition of the Supervisory Board.  One focus of the Nominating Committee\u2019s activities in  fiscal 2023 was the preparation of the Supervisory  Board\u2019s nominations of shareholder representatives on  the Supervisory Board for election by the 2023 Annual  Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. The Nominating Committee was  supported in this connection by an external consulting  firm. In selecting the potential candidates and in prepar- ing a recommendation for the Supervisory Board\u2019s deci- sion, the Nominating Committee gave particular consid- eration to the objectives that the Supervisory Board had  previously approved for its composition \u2013 including the  profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity  concept for the Supervisory Board \u2013 and to the Supervi- sory Board\u2019s qualification matrix. With a view to the reg- ular elections of three shareholder representatives on the  Supervisory Board scheduled for 2025, the Nominating  Committee also defined the topics for its work over the  next few years and concerned itself with the regulatory  framework, with the objectives that the Supervisory  Board had approved for its composition, including the  profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity  concept for the Supervisory Board, and with the qualifi- cation matrix. The Mediation Committee had no need to meet. The Compensation Committee met four times. All four  meetings were held in person. The Compensation Com- mittee also made one decision using other customary  means of communication. The Committee prepared, in  particular, Supervisory Board decisions regarding the  definition of performance criteria and the targets for vari- able compensation, regarding the determination and  regarding the review of the appropriateness of Managing  Board compensation and regarding the Compensation  Report. In addition, the Compensation Committee pre- pared the Supervisory Board\u2019s decision regarding the en- gagement of an auditor for the Compensation Report for  fiscal 2023. One focus of the Compensation Committee\u2019s  work was the preparation of the Supervisory Board\u2019s de- cision regarding the adjustment of the compensation  system for the members of the Managing Board as of   fiscal 2024. Independent external consultants were also  involved in the preparation of this decision."}, {"knowledge": "Report of the Supervisory Board The Innovation and Finance Committee met two times.  Both meetings were held in person. A decision was also  made using other customary means of communication.  The focus of the Committee\u2019s work was on innovation-  and technology-related topics.

In the strategic context, it concerned it self with  progress regarding Siemens Xcelerator, the Company\u2019s  open digital business platform. Detailed growth plans for  the portfolio and new Siemens Xcelerator portfolio   elements were presented. Expanding the ecosystem and  increasing the relevance of the marketplace were also  focus topics. Under the heading \u201cUX Transformation,\u201d the  Managing Board reported on progress in user-centered  product design. The Committee\u2019s meetings and/or   decisions also focused on the discussion of the pension  system and the preparation and approval of investment  and divestment projects and/or financial measures.

The  Committee discussed the Half-year Financial Report and  the quarterly statements with the Managing Board and  the independent auditors. In the presence of the inde- pendent auditors, it also discussed the report on the au- ditors\u2019 review of the Company\u2019s Half-year Consolidated  Financial Statements and of its Interim Group Manage- ment Report. As part of the preparation and implemen- tation of the audit, the Audit Committee regularly ex- changed views with the independent auditors without  the Managing Board in attendance. In addition, it met  regularly without the Managing Board and/or the inde- pendent auditors in attendance. Outside its meetings,  the Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly ex- changed views with the independent auditors regarding  the progress of the audit and reported to the Audit Com- mittee thereon. The Audit Committee recommended that  the Supervisory Board propose to the Annual Sharehold- ers\u2019 Meeting that Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fc- fungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, be elected independent  auditors for fiscal 2023. It awarded the audit contract for  fiscal 2023 to the independent auditors, who had been  elected by the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, defined  the audit\u2019s focus areas and determined the auditors\u2019 fee.  The Audit Committee approved the audit plan and defined  the Audit Committee\u2019s focus areas. It monitored the selec- tion, independence, qualification, rotation and efficiency  of the independent auditors as well as the services they  provided and concerned itself with the review of the qual- ity of the audit of the financial statements. In fiscal 2023,  against the backdrop of the Wirecard situation, the Audit  Committee regularly discussed the role of Ernst & Young  GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, as the  independent auditors of Wirecard AG. The Audit Commit- tee questioned the independent auditors regarding this  matter and assessed the impact on Siemens AG. The Audit  Committee also dealt with the Company\u2019s accounting and  accounting process, the appropriateness and effective- ness of its internal control system and its risk manage- ment system (including sustainability-related aspects),  and the effectiveness, resources and findings of its inter- nal audit as well as with reports concerning potential and  pending legal disputes. In addition, the Audit Committee  concerned itself with the Company\u2019s compliance with   legal requirements, official regulations and the  Company\u2019s  internal guidelines (compliance) and dealt, in particular,  with the quarterly reports, the Chief Compliance Officer\u2019s  annual report and the compliance management system.  For this topic, the Managing Board member responsible  for People & Organization also attended the Audit Com- mittee meetings at the invitation of the Audit Committee  Chairman. In this connection, the Audit Committee   concerned itself with the implementation of the new   German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichten\u00ad gesetz, LkSG). It also focused on the current and future  regulatory requirements regarding sustainability report- ing and its implementation, including, in particular, the  requirements of the EU taxonomy and the Corporate   Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Finally, the"}, {"knowledge": "Report of the Supervisory Board  Audit Committee concerned itself in fiscal 2023 \u2013 due to  the regular, legally required external rotation of the   independent auditors at the end of fiscal 2023 \u2013 with the  selection and transition procedure for the audit of the   financial statements for fiscal 2024. The Supervisory Board members take part, on their own  responsibility, in the educational and training measures  necessary for the performance of their duties \u2013 measures  relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework  and to new, groundbreaking technologies. The Company  supports them in this regard. Internal informational  events are regularly offered to support targeted training  measures. In March and July of fiscal 2023, three internal  training events concerning strategically relevant tech- nology and sustainability-related topics were held for  all Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board   informed itself, in particular, about industrial and   generative artificial intelligence and discussed the tech- nological background, application and impact on  Siemens\u2019 markets as well as the technology-related and  regulatory challenges. New Supervisory Board members can meet with Manag- ing Board members and other managers with specialist  responsibility to exchange views on current topics and  topics of fundamental importance and thus gain an   overview of Company-relevant matters (onboarding). In  fiscal 2023, a separate informational event for the new  members of the Supervisory Board was held on March 13,  2023, to familiarize those members, in particular, with  the Company\u2019s business model and strategy and with the  structures of the Siemens Group. As part of this onboard- ing program, Supervisory Board members also have the  opportunity to visit the various locations of different  Siemens business areas and gain an insight into the port- folio as well as production and manufacturing methods.  Longer-serving Supervisory Board members may also  attend onboarding events and regularly do so. Disclosure of participation by individual Supervisory Board members in meetings The average rate of participation by members in the  meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees  was 97 %.

No major  weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control or risk  management systems were reported. At this meeting,  the Managing Board explained the financial statements  of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as well as the  Company\u2019s risk management system.

Sustainability is one of the  focus topics of the Supervisory Board\u2019s work. Sustain\u00ad ability is of such central importance for Siemens that it  is discussed regularly and in detail at the Supervisory  Board\u2019s plenary meetings. As a cross\u00adcutting issue,   sustainability touches on the areas of responsibility of  several committees. To the extent that sustainability   affects reporting, the Audit Committee considers   sustainability\u00adrelated questions in detail and reports on  these matters at the Supervisory Board\u2019s plenary meet\u00ad ings. To prepare for discussions and decisions at these  meetings, the sustainability\u00adrelated aspects of Managing  Board compensation are dealt with in the Compensation  Committee.

Targets, within the meaning of Section 76 para. 4 of the  German Stock Corporation Act, for the quota of women at the two management levels below the Managing Board; Information on Managing Board compliance with the participation require\u00adment and Supervisory Board compliance with minimum  gender quota requirements Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Man\u00ad aging Board of Siemens AG must include at least one  woman and at least one man (minimum participation  requirement). In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG complied with  this  requirement. Beyond the minimum participation re\u00ad quirement, the consideration of women is an essential  aspect of the Supervisory Board\u2019s long\u00adterm succession  planning for the Managing Board. When filling managerial positions at the Company, the  Managing Board takes diversity into account and, in partic\u00ad ular, aims for an appropriate consideration of women and  internationality. In May 2022, in compliance with the   German legal requirements set out in Section 76 para. 4 of  the German Stock Corporation Act, the Managing Board set  the targets for the percentage of women in  management  positions at Siemens AG that will apply until September 30,  2025, as follows: 30 % for the first management level below  the Managing Board and 25 % for the second management  level below the Managing Board. On the basis of projected  employee figures, women will, accordingly, hold a total  of four of the 13 positions at Siemens AG at the first   management level below the Managing Board and a  t otal of 32 of the 126 positions at Siemens AG at the   second management level below the Managing Board.  For the Siemens Group worldwide, the targets set out in  the Companywide DEGREE sustainability framework  continue to apply without change. The composition of the Supervisory Board fulfilled the   legal requirements regarding the minimum gender quota  in the reporting period. Statutory provisions on the equal participation of men and  women in management positions that may be applicable to  Group companies other than Siemens AG remain unaffected.  6. Diversity concept for the  Managing Board and long\u00adterm succession planning For the composition of the Managing Board, the follow\u00ad ing diversity concept applies:  \u201cThe goal of this diversity concept is to achieve a com\u00ad position that is as diverse as possible and comprises  individuals who complement one another in a Manag\u00ad ing Board that provides strong leadership and brings  different perspectives to the management of the  Company as well as to ensure that, as a group, the  members of the Managing Board have all the know\u00ad how and skills that are considered essential in view of  Siemens\u2019 activities. When selecting members of the Managing Board, the  Supervisory Board pays close attention to candidates\u2019  personal suitability, integrity, convincing leadership  qualities, international experience, expertise in their  prospective areas of responsibility, achievements to  date and knowledge of the Company as well as their  ability to adjust business models and processes in a  changing world. Diversity with respect to such charac\u00ad teristics as age and gender as well as professional and  educational background is an important selection cri\u00ad terion for appointments to Managing Board positions.  When selecting members of the Managing Board, the  Supervisory Board also gives special consideration to  the following factors:  In addition to the expertise and management and  leadership experience required for their specific  tasks, the Managing Board members shall have the  broadest possible range of knowledge and experi\u00ad ence and the widest possible educational and pro\u00ad fessional backgrounds.  Taking the Company\u2019s international orientation  into account, the composition of the Managing  Board shall reflect internationality with respect to  different cultural backgrounds and international  experience (such as extensive professional experi\u00ad ence in foreign countries and responsibility for  business activities in foreign countries in areas that  are relevant for Siemens).  As a group, the Managing Board shall have experi\u00ad ence in the business areas that are important for  Siemens \u2013 in particular, in the industry, infrastruc\u00ad ture, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors."}, {"knowledge": "10 Corporate Governance Statement   As a group, the Managing Board shall have many  years of experience in technology (including infor\u00ad mation technology, digitalization and cybersecu\u00ad rity), sustainability, transformation, procurement,  manufacturing, research and development, sales,  finance, risk management, law (including compli\u00ad ance) and human resources.  Diversity also means gender diversity. According to  the legal requirement applicable to Siemens AG  (Section 76 para. 3a of the German Stock Corpora\u00ad tion Act), the Managing Board must include at least  one woman and at least one man (minimum partic\u00ad ipation requirement). Beyond the minimum partici\u00ad pation requirement, the consideration of women is  an essential aspect of the Supervisory Board\u2019s long\u00ad term succession planning for the Managing Board.  It is considered helpful if different age groups are  represented on the Managing Board. In accordance  with the recommendation of the Code, the Super\u00ad visory Board has defined an age limit for the mem\u00ad bers of the Managing Board. In keeping with this  limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as  a rule, to be not older than 67 years of age. When making an appointment to a specific Managing  Board position, the decisive factor is always the Com\u00ad pany\u2019s best interest, taking into consideration all cir\u00ad cumstances in the individual case.\u201d Implementation of the diversity concept for the Managing Board in fiscal 2023 The diversity concept for the Managing Board is imple\u00ad mented as part of the process for making appointments  to the Managing Board. When selecting candidates  and / or making proposals for the appointment of Manag\u00ad ing Board members, the Supervisory Board and / or the  Chairman\u2019s Committee of the Supervisory Board take into  account the requirements defined in the diversity con\u00ad cept for the Managing Board.  In its current composition, the Managing Board fulfills all  the requirements of the diversity concept. The Managing  Board members have a broad range of knowledge, expe\u00ad rience and educational and professional backgrounds as  well as international experience. The Managing Board  has all the knowledge and experience that is considered  essential in view of Siemens\u2019 activities. As a group, the  Managing Board has experience in the business areas  that are important for Siemens \u2013 in particular, in the   industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare  sectors \u2013 as well as many years of experience in tech\u00ad nology (including information technology, digitalization  and cybersecurity), sustainability, transformation, pro\u00ad curement, manufacturing, research and development,  sales, finance, risk management, law (including compli\u00ad ance) and human resources.  Siemens AG complies with the minimum participation  requirement set out in Section 76 para. 3 a of the German  Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board has one   female member, Judith Wiese. Beyond the minimum   participation requirement, the consideration of women  is a key component of the Supervisory Board\u2019s long\u00adterm  succession planning for the Managing Board. Different  age groups are represented on the Managing Board. No  Managing Board member has reached the stipulated   regular age limit. Long-term succession planning for the Managing Board Jointly with the Managing Board and with the support of  the Chairman\u2019s Committee, the Supervisory Board con\u00ad ducts long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing  Board. Long\u00adterm succession planning is systematic and  based on the strategic target setting of the Company.  Taking into account the concrete qualification require\u00ad ments and the diversity concept that the Supervisory  Board has approved for the Managing Board\u2019s compo\u00ad sition, the Chairman\u2019s Committee prepares ideal profiles.  When a concrete decision regarding succession is to be  made, the Chairman\u2019s Committee compiles a shortlist of  the available candidates on the basis of these profiles.  Structured interviews are then conducted with these   candidates. After the interviews, a recommendation is  submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval. When  developing the profile of requirements and selecting   candidates, the Supervisory Board and / or the Chairman\u2019s  Committee are supported, if necessary, by external   consultants."}, {"knowledge": "11 Corporate Governance Statement  7.

In particular, the Supervisory Board shall  also include members who have leadership experi\u00ad ence as senior executives or members of a supervisory  board (or comparable body) at a major company with  international operations. When a new member is to be appointed, a review  shall be performed to determine which of the areas  of expertise deemed desirable for the Supervisory  Board are to be strengthened. Internationality Taking the Company\u2019s international orientation into  account, care shall be taken to ensure that the Super\u00ad visory Board has an adequate number of members  with extensive international experience.

The Supervisory Board members shall have sufficient  time to exercise their mandates with the necessary  regularity and diligence. Limits on age and on length of membership In compliance with the age limit stipulated by the Super\u00ad visory Board in its Bylaws, only individuals who are no  older than 70 years of age shall, as a rule, be nominated  for election to the Supervisory Board. Nominations shall  take into account the regular limit established by the   Supervisory Board, which restricts membership on the  Supervisory Board to a maximum of three full terms of  office.

In pre paring the nominations of the seven shareholder  representatives elected by the 2023 Annual Shareholders\u2019  Meeting, the  Supervisory Board and the Nominating  Committee took these objectives \u2013 including the profile  of required skills and expertise and the diversity con\u00ad cept \u2013 into consideration. The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that, with its   current composition, it meets the objectives for its compo\u00ad sition and fulfills the profile of required skills and expertise  as well as the diversity concept.

Share transactions by  members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards Pursuant to Article 19 of EU Regulation No. 596 / 2014 of  the European Parliament and Council of April 16, 2014,  on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation), members of  the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are   legally required to disclose all transactions conducted on  their own account relating to the shares or debt instru\u00ad ments of Siemens AG or to the derivatives or financial  instruments linked thereto if the total value of such trans\u00ad actions entered into by a board member or any closely  associated person in any calendar year reaches or ex\u00ad ceeds \u20ac 20,000. All transactions reported to Siemens AG  in fiscal 2023 have been duly published and are available  on the Siemens Global Website at  WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ 9. Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting and investor relations Shareholders exercise their rights at the Annual Share\u00ad holders\u2019 Meeting. An ordinary Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meet\u00ad ing normally takes place within the first five months of  each fiscal year. The Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting de\u00ad cides, among other things, on the appropriation of net  income, the ratification of the acts of the members of the  Managing and Supervisory Boards, and the appointment  of the independent auditors. Amendments to the Articles  of Association and measures that change the Company\u2019s  capital stock are approved at the Annual Shareholders\u2019  Meeting and implemented by the Managing Board. The  Managing Board facilitates shareholder participation in  this meeting through electronic communications \u2013 in par\u00ad ticular, via the Internet \u2013 and enables shareholders who  are unable to attend the meeting to vote by proxy. Proxies  can also be reached during the Annual Shareholders\u2019  Meeting. Furthermore, shareholders may exercise their  right to vote in writing or by means of electronic commu\u00ad nications (absentee voting). The Managing Board may  enable shareholders to participate in the Annual Share\u00ad holders\u2019 Meeting without the need to be present at the  venue and without a proxy and to exercise some or all of  their rights fully or partially by means of electronic com\u00ad munications. The Company enables shareholders to follow  the entire Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting via the Internet.  Shareholders may submit motions regarding the proposals  of the Managing and Supervisory Boards and may contest  decisions of the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. Sharehold\u00ad ers owning Siemens stock with an aggregate notional  value of \u20ac 100,000 or more may also demand the judicial  appointment of special auditors to examine specific is\u00ad sues. The reports, documents and information required by  law for the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, including the  Annual Financial Report, can be downloaded from the  Siemens Global Website. The same applies to the agenda  for the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting and to any counter\u00ad proposals or shareholders\u2019 nominations that may require  disclosure. For the election of shareholder representatives  on the Supervisory Board, a detailed curriculum vitae of  every candidate is published.  Pursuant to a decision by the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meet\u00ad ing on February 9, 2023, the Articles of Association have  been amended and the Managing Board has been autho\u00ad rized to allow for the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting to be  held without shareholders or their representatives being  physically present at the place of the Annual Shareholders\u2019  Meeting (virtual shareholders\u2019 meeting). This authoriza\u00ad tion applies to holding virtual shareholders\u2019 meetings in a  period of two years after the registration of this amend\u00ad ment in the Company\u2019s commercial registers. This regis\u00ad tration took place in May 2023. As part of our investor relations activities, we inform our  investors comprehensively about developments within  the Company. For communication purposes, Siemens  makes extensive use of the Internet. We publish quarterly  statements, Half\u00adyear and Annual Financial Reports,  earnings releases, ad hoc announcements, analyst   presentations, letters to shareholders and press releases  as well as the financial calendar for the current year,  which contains the publication dates of significant   financial communications and the date of the Annual  Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, at  WWW.SIEMENS.COM/INVESTORS.
