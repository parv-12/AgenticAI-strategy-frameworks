The RAGC (or a subset of its representatives such as the chief financial officer) is responsible for creating the framework and \\nsupporting policies that are necessary to address climate-related issues. This includes reviewing and guiding the strategy and annual budgets, setting performance objectives, monitoring and \\noverseeing progress against climate-related goals and targets, reviewing material climate-related risks, and approving global policies relating to social responsibility. \\n Furthermore, our air-travel emissions footprint is reviewed quarterly by the Acceleration Team (AT) for progress against our science-based targets (SBTs), and the AT discusses actions needed and \\ndecisions required from the RAGC. The AT is our global leadership body composed of the managing partner and firm leaders representing regions, industries, client capabilities, finance, people, and \\nrisk functions. \\n The ESG Council, represented by senior firm function and client service leaders, oversees our ESG agenda, including environmental sustainability topics, by defining our priorities, setting our \\ndirection, and monitoring progress.

They are supported by the leader of Global Social \\nResponsibility, as well as the director of Environmental Sustainability who has overall day-to-day responsibility for addressing climate change and sustainability more broadly within the firm. \\n Within each of our offices, the local managing partner (senior partner level) has responsibility for the impact of climate change on the office\\u2019s operations. Furthermore, each region has an SBT \\nregional leader (senior partner level) who is accountable for achieving our 2025 near-term SBTs. The director of Environmental Sustainability convenes the SBT regional leaders on a quarterly basis \\nto review progress and discuss best practices, roadblocks, and actions planned.

Describe the resilience of \\nthe organization\\u2019s strategy, \\ntaking into consideration \\ndifferent climate-related \\nscenarios, including a 2\\u00b0C  \\nor lower scenario\\n In 2022, a cross-functional team composed of McKinsey climate scientists, consultants, economists, leaders in the sustainability practice, and risk and finance professionals conducted climate-\\nrelated scenario analysis to project the financial and strategic implications of evolving physical and transition impacts of our firm\\u2019s strategy and business model (using 2021 data). Our choice of \\nclimate scenarios weighed alignment to temperature pathways and policy actions.

It quantifies strong \\nimpacts from transitional risks (for example, carbon prices) and innovation, and is included to reflect the net-zero pathway many governments and companies have publicly committed to.\\n \\u2022   The 1.6\\u00baC\\u20132\\u00baC scenario, which uses UNPRI\\u2019s \\u201cForecast Policy Scenario,\\u201d capping warming to 1.8 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by 2100. This is based on a high-conviction forecast of \\nforceful policy in response to climate change and related implications for energy, vehicles, and carbon prices.\\n Results of the climate-related scenario analysis\\n Cost of emissions change: Based on evolving carbon prices globally, carbon emissions are likely to become increasingly expensive over time. Our scenario analysis included three point-in-time \\ncalculations in 2025, 2030, and 2050. The main source of these emissions is business travel (approximately 80% of firm emissions in 2019). As part of our analysis, forecasted carbon prices from \\nUNPRI\\u2019s \\u201cRequired Policy Scenario\\u201d were weighted across geographies based on our emissions. According to UNPRI\\u2019s, \\u201cRequired Policy Scenario\\u201d, carbon prices of $45\\u201385 per ton and  \\n$87\\u2013175 per ton will be needed by 2030 and 2050 respectively. Carbon pricing from regulations are not likely to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business as we do not \\noperate in an emissions-intensive industry and we have committed to reaching net zero by 2030. \\n People and physical assets most exposed: As a global firm that operates in 65+ countries, we have offices that are likely to be exposed to both acute and chronic physical risks in the near, \\nmedium, and long term. In our scenario analysis, we assessed the impact of physical risks, including riverine and coastal flooding, extreme heat, and hurricanes, aligned to different climate pathways \\n(1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius). We used McKinsey Climate Resilience Analytics downscaled CMIP5 models, as well as data from WRI and WindRisk Tech. Our analysis found that approximately 31.5K \\ncolleagues are based in metropolitan areas that may be exposed to severe flooding globally and approximately 12.5K to hurricanes, especially in the Eastern US and Western Pacific. Despite these \\nexposures, our investments in business continuity planning and the nature of our business mean these acute physical events do not present a substantive safety, financial, or strategic impact on our \\nbusiness. \\n Effect on sectors we serve: We work with clients across sectors, sizes, and geographies. To assess the climate transition and physical impacts on the companies we serve, we conducted scenario \\nanalysis using Planetrics, our climate analytics suite. The analysis evaluated the impacts of decarbonization on the average valuations of companies in the sectors and regional industries that we \\nserve. The analysis included three scenarios: the Required Policy Response (to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100), the Forecasted Policy Response (to limit \\nwarming to 1.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100), and Network for Greening the Financial System\\u2019s (NGFS) \\u201cHot-house World,\\u201d where little policy action is taken. We found \\ndownside risk from carbon pricing and demand destruction to be mostly concentrated in hard-to-abate sectors after 2040.
