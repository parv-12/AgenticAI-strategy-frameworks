[{"knowledge": "4SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROL TOWERS: A SIMPLER ROUTE TO FULL VISIBILITYwww.abiresearch.com Possibilities Unlocked by Adopting an SCCT ABI Research has assessed numerous SCCT providers in the market. The top vendors allow customers to obtain the following business outcomes after adopting the technology.  A supply chain digital twin is the Holy Grail of SCCT solutions, creating a virtual replica of current operations. This gives organizations real-time visibility of stock allocations, driver movements, delivery, and other key events.  For example, as a leading SCCT vendor, SAP allows users to create a digital twin of a supply chain within the SAP Business Network. The company leverages partnerships with project44, Shippeo, and FourKites to feed real-time tracking data to the digital twin. From there, the solution identifies issues and performs a risk assessment to gauge the impact on sales, inventory, and revenue. At the heart of the digital twin is data aggregation, which is collected via Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as scanners, tags, trackers, and management systems (WMS, TMS, YMS, ERP, etc.). These data can be organized into three broad categories:  1)  vehicle level (track stock movements);  2)  aggregation level (condition-based monitoring of assets such as pallets, crates,       and containers), and  3)  item level (digital Identity (ID) application to products at a unit level). As previously alluded to, advanced SCCT solutions perform risk assessments. The visibility afforded by an SCCT allows it to identify internal and external risks to supply chain operations. This could be an incoming snowstorm, inventory shrinkage, a port backup, or even a trade dispute between two countries. Wherever the risk exists, the SCCT automatically detects it and can notify end users of which stock or processes will be impacted. This level of visibility allows organizations to take on a more proactive role and less of a reactionary role, getting out in front of supply chain issues before the impact festers. Autonomous risk assessment is favorable over manual assessment, which can be time-consuming and require sophisticated evaluation of current circumstances. The risk assessment capabilities of an SCCT are even more robust when the solution is built on a cloud network.  The digital twin capabilities of SCCTs allow organizations to test various scenarios and assess the impact of proposed decisions. Users can run simulations of events and experiment with various factors. To illustrate, an automotive manufacturer might want to gauge the impact induced by an Electric Vehicle (EV) battery shortage and identify the best course of action to alleviate issues. This will allow the manufacturer to \u201cexperience\u201d the battery shortage without actually having to experience it. However, the lessons learned in the simulation will be essential to overcoming potential shortages in the future. The same principle applies to any industry and scenario, from blocked trade routes to driver shortages."}, {"knowledge": "5SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROL TOWERS: A SIMPLER ROUTE TO FULL VISIBILITYwww.abiresearch.com While the digital twin is a proactive tool, SCCTs can also help supply chain leaders manage a  problem after it has occurred. End users can input specific supply chain conditions, and the SCCT  will generate a list of possible solutions to the problem. Whether the SCCT is used for proactive  or reactive measures, AI and Machine Learning (ML) are the unsung heroes of the solution\u2019s  capabilities. AI and ML make sense of the vast sums of historical and live data, identifying  underlying trends and learning from past results. An SCCT\u2019s ability to provide full visibility of the inbound supply chain allows organizations to run multi-faceted cost-saving projects. Normally, if an organization wants to reduce costs, they look at where the transport costs of the supplier can be cut. Avenues for cost-savings are limited due  to limited supply chain visibility. With an SCCT, the entire network can be optimized because the solution can factor in multiple suppliers, routes to the market, and the logistics solutions used.  ABI Research identifies the following three key opportunities for network-wide optimization using an SCCT: 1) Groupage: Consolidate shipments from multiple suppliers into fewer trucks. 2) Using Economies of Scale: Transporting shipments from multiple suppliers is cheaper    when higher volumes are allocated to one provider.  3) Travel Reduction: Some of the leading SCCT vendors, notably Siemens (Digital Logistics),    offer robust network optimization solutions that recommend the best logistical routes.    Optimized routing reduces transport costs, gets shipments to their destination on time,    and curbs the carbon footprint. Global supply chains are very sophisticated, necessitating harmony between various stakeholders. Often, key stakeholders are not all on the same page due to a disconnected ecosystem. If a supplier, for example, is left out of the loop about an upcoming retail sale, all stakeholders could miss a revenue opportunity. This is where an SCCT is highly appealing to organizations aiming to streamline collaboration between stakeholders.  An SCCT is a central communication hub for supply chain partners, often including a chatroom where users can provide real-time updates. Moreover, these SCCT collaboration tools typically allow users to adjust strategies and resolutions that are in progress. For example, customers of One Network Enterprises can use an in-platform chat feature that facilitates personal and group chats tied to a single transaction or issue. This ensures a clear audit trail during the issue resolution process. Solutions like this provide key stakeholders with access to the same critical information, resulting in better decision-making capabilities and improved synergy between supply chain partners."}, {"knowledge": "6SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROL TOWERS: A SIMPLER ROUTE TO FULL VISIBILITYwww.abiresearch.com Advancements in AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have allowed modern SCCTs to act as  automated decision-makers for supply chain operators. SCCTs not only identify supply chain  issues, but AI tools can choose the best resolution without any need for human intervention.  Automated decision-making accelerates the time it takes to address supply chain bottlenecks, thus  mitigating the impact to a firm\u2019s bottom line. The SCCT will transmit the desired action back to the  relevant stakeholder(s) via an actionable signal or LLM-generated messages. As beneficial as automated decision-making can be for supply chain management, there are  drawbacks. For one thing, organizations are hesitant to give AI full autonomy over important  decisions. Understandably, organizations still want some human oversight over key strategies  and resolutions. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative that SCCT solutions allow for AI guardrails, letting  organizations oversee certain processes and audit every action, output, and recommendation\u2014to  ensure compliance with laws and applicable regulations. Another concern about automated decision-making is the fact that AI-supported SCCTs cannot  account for every piece of data and information. For example, if a decision was made over a phone  call or email and not uploaded to a system, the SCCT wouldn\u2019t be able to take the optimal action.  To overcome this challenge, it\u2019s important that users tell the SCCT which data and information are  high priority. \u2003 Market Outlook for SCCTs SCCT market players come in three flavors:  1) Established supply chain system providers, bringing their point solutions into a    unified platform  2) Big data analytics firms tailoring their solutions for SCCT applications 3) Emerging E2E supply chain software providers Big-name supply chain players in Category 1 (SAP, Blue Yonder, etc.) are currently the market  leaders for SCCT solutions. However, ABI Research foresees emerging vendors focused on the  sole network (One Network Enterprises, Blume Global, etc.) slicing into the market share as they  provide an effective alternative to optimizing the supply chain network. While SCCT revenue growth is expected across all regions through 2030, European and North American organizations are the adoption leaders worldwide. This is thanks to many established vendors based on these continents and the growing asset tracking regulation driving investment for supply chain visibility solutions. With that said, the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions are set to experience robust growth rates through the forecast period. Overall SCCT revenue will grow at a CAGR of 13.12% between 2024 and 2030, increasing from US$9.63 billion to more than US$20 billion."}, {"knowledge": "7SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROL TOWERS: A SIMPLER ROUTE TO FULL VISIBILITYwww.abiresearch.com North America: SCCT revenue is the most in North America throughout the forecast period,  generating US$3.55 billion in 2024 before increasing to US$6.2 billion by 2030.
